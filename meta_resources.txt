11/9/20, 2:25 PM - Rishabh: Haan thats why its called meta-resources meaning list of lists we can directly include that link to the github we are not creating a new list but aggregating everything in one place.
11/9/20, 2:25 PM - +91 83558 14130: Haan Cs vid waale ka link daal dete hai phir

11/9/20, 2:27 PM - Rishabh: Yeah it could be a useful addition to the UROP website, rather than directly doing reseach better to start with aggregating resources learn and then go from there.

11/11/20, 11:19 AM - Rishabh: I'll add more on the YT in sometime if you want to add these go ahead, I'll start updating the neuroscience one as well
11/11/20, 11:20 AM - Rishabh: Also if someone wants to do domain specific links go ahead.
11/11/20, 11:20 AM - +91 83558 14130: will add these 2 in 10 minutes
11/11/20, 11:21 AM - Rishabh: Cool
11/11/20, 1:20 PM - +91 83558 14130: commited
11/11/20, 1:20 PM - Rishabh: üëç
11/11/20, 1:44 PM - Rishabh: Can add sections for talks/workshops/seminars/ conferences we don't have that
11/11/20, 1:45 PM - V: Like I said scheduler ke aandar hi aajaega
11/11/20, 1:46 PM - Rishabh: Scheduler is too much overhead to develop, better to have a list of links like we have for others?
11/11/20, 1:47 PM - +91 83558 14130: +1
11/11/20, 1:47 PM - +91 83558 14130: sure
11/11/20, 1:47 PM - V: Ek static section
11/11/20, 1:47 PM - Rishabh: Too complicated to update, also I'm referring to past talks etc.
11/11/20, 1:48 PM - V: Acha
11/11/20, 1:48 PM - V: Conferences must watch aur uske section ke niche links
11/11/20, 1:48 PM - Rishabh: eg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnexb5vuCRk&list=PLrcr1zcpLZb7paw9LNgx-zsCr-PstjBM6
11/11/20, 1:49 PM - Rishabh: Must watch kuch nehi hota ACM nehi hai yeh bas title and links what people wnt to watch is upto them lol
11/11/20, 1:50 PM - V: Ok
11/11/20, 1:52 PM - Rishabh: True but content curate kaise karenga in 1000s of links
11/11/20, 1:52 PM - V: Beautiful Soup goes brrr
11/11/20, 1:53 PM - +91 83558 14130: Ye links sab MUST WATCH waale hi honge
11/11/20, 1:53 PM - +91 83558 14130: like hypothetically
11/11/20, 1:53 PM - +91 83558 14130: Bas videos ka banane mein gaand lag jaayegi
11/11/20, 1:54 PM - +91 83558 14130: elaborate?
11/11/20, 1:54 PM - V: Data scraping manually bohot difficult hai itne links dekhna aur arrange karna
11/11/20, 1:55 PM - +91 83558 14130: duniya bhar ke links kaise laayega scrape karke
11/11/20, 1:55 PM - +91 83558 14130: waise bhi yeh sab curate toh karna hi hoga na Aek baar scrape karne ke baad
11/11/20, 1:55 PM - Rishabh: Not really its list of lists so one list can contain the entire playlist doable and open-source so pull reqs.
11/11/20, 1:56 PM - +91 83558 14130: Good idea
11/11/20, 1:56 PM - +91 83558 14130: Aek alag yt acxount banakar daal dete hai?
11/11/20, 1:56 PM - +91 83558 14130: Aise paste karne lagegnge gaand phat jayegi
11/11/20, 1:56 PM - +91 83558 14130: Like Conf ka Aek PlayList then link, workshop ka Aek PlayList phir link
11/11/20, 1:57 PM - Rishabh: Easier to do links no ?
11/11/20, 1:57 PM - +91 83558 14130: Aek Aek link kholkar dekhna padega na phir
11/11/20, 1:58 PM - Rishabh: not really take top tier confereces to start with
11/11/20, 1:59 PM - +91 83558 14130: I mean sab aisi hi paste kar rahe hai hamlong na
11/11/20, 1:59 PM - Rishabh: also generally they have compilation of the vieo playlist of all years for conferences.
11/11/20, 1:59 PM - +91 83558 14130: Markdown mein daalde link
11/11/20, 1:59 PM - +91 83558 14130: Naam ke saath thoda easy hoga
11/11/20, 1:59 PM - +91 83558 14130: nahi toh too mnt redundant links
11/11/20, 1:59 PM - Rishabh: or channel based is easier https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN1VdJ3t4zbqJVg1Q9ztF5A
11/11/20, 2:00 PM - +91 83558 14130: As in?
11/11/20, 2:00 PM - Rishabh: Link to channel with the all videos for one conference.
11/11/20, 2:01 PM - +91 83558 14130: Accha cool
11/11/20, 2:14 PM - Rishabh: Search would be easier with the description and the metadata everythig on one static page and then you can CTRL+F to seacrh everything @ once eg. http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dwoodruf/
11/11/20, 2:14 PM - +91 83558 14130: Hmm I got what you are talking about
11/11/20, 2:15 PM - +91 83558 14130: I think out list would be bigger than theirs
11/11/20, 2:15 PM - +91 83558 14130: so It would be good to have 2-3 static pages
11/11/20, 2:15 PM - +91 83558 14130: The MAIN one could host all topics and then expand on that
11/11/20, 2:15 PM - Rishabh: How much time does it take to load a static page?
11/11/20, 2:15 PM - +91 83558 14130: donno know
11/11/20, 2:16 PM - Rishabh: with say 10**5 links?
11/11/20, 2:16 PM - +91 83558 14130: Wouldn't take too long ? But user itna pada page scroll karega?
11/11/20, 2:17 PM - Rishabh: Nope just search option at the top of control F since its all text?

11/11/20, 2:19 PM - V: Select *
From List
11/11/20, 2:19 PM - +91 83558 14130: bsdk text search karna hai
11/11/20, 2:19 PM - +91 83558 14130: Woh sirf columns nikalega
11/11/20, 2:19 PM - V: Jo bhi you got the message
11/11/20, 2:19 PM - +91 83558 14130: it's faster
11/11/20, 2:20 PM - V: Wildcards op
11/11/20, 2:21 PM - Rishabh: Better to start with all links in one page: extract meta-data , then go from there
11/11/20, 2:21 PM - +91 83558 14130: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/fulltext-search.html
11/11/20, 2:21 PM - +91 83558 14130: yaya later
11/11/20, 2:42 PM - Rishabh: Better this way just update the Github repo and it would automatically pull the content from there.
11/11/20, 4:23 PM - +91 83558 14130: @919717945717  Brave mein ads nahi hai kya?

12/4/20, 12:11 PM - Rishabh: I am kindof for Google, what people don't understand is that when you go to work at a company you work for the company's interest not solely yours, they can censor any content/anything else that goes against their interest.
12/4/20, 12:12 PM - +91 83558 14130: Nah
12/4/20, 12:12 PM - +91 83558 14130: Google aur bhi bahut kaand kiya hai bhai
12/4/20, 12:12 PM - Rishabh: Also their making a decision for her to resign was ok, thy didn't want to meet her demands so they let her go.
12/4/20, 12:12 PM - +91 83558 14130: 4 workers illegally removed
12/4/20, 12:12 PM - +91 83558 14130: han resignation I agree but not the practices
12/4/20, 12:12 PM - Rishabh: I know, I'm talking about this specific instance.
12/4/20, 12:13 PM - Rishabh: NO one can be ilegally removed, everyone signs contracts.
12/4/20, 12:13 PM - +91 83558 14130: I read an entire verge article where they said Google changed their policy which prevents any sort of activisim
12/4/20, 12:13 PM - Rishabh: Even if google breaks those they are liable.
12/4/20, 12:14 PM - +91 83558 14130: which basically means Google could sell software to Military wagera without people at googlw working knowing ki woh software is purpose ke liye hai
12/4/20, 12:14 PM - Rishabh: They maybe unfair but once the people sign it take the money, then they should not have the audacity to come out and make these comments, never do we hear about these things when they are on their Payroll only once they are let go
12/4/20, 12:14 PM - +91 83558 14130: NLRB deemed them as illegal removals kuch national labour commision type kuch hai
12/4/20, 12:14 PM - Rishabh: Yes
12/4/20, 12:15 PM - Rishabh: The work that they do is Google's IP they pay for it.
12/4/20, 12:16 PM - +91 83558 14130: Anadar hi andar voice uthathe haina , cause I read Google earlier was like Googley banne ka aek part hai criticism uthao , ab ye log policy sab change kar diya in 2k18 which prevents any sort of activisim Right or Wrong, no meetings too to discuss these issues with managers , bas forum pe daal sakte ho
12/4/20, 12:17 PM - Rishabh: OK thats their policy this women knew about it; why did she join anyways?
12/4/20, 12:17 PM - +91 83558 14130: Also Googlers earlier were allpwed to almost any docs through internal search tools , but after the change many docs were deemed as not to know and one who sees them basically investigation and cann and You cannot even meet and protest , bas forum pe daalo as of anything will hapoen

12/4/20, 12:17 PM - Rishabh: Why does anyone join knowing this?

12/4/20, 12:19 PM - Rishabh: Dr. Gebru has faced defensiveness, racism, gaslighting, research censorship, and now a retaliatory firing. In an email to Dr. Gebru‚Äôs team on the evening of December 2, 2020, Google executives claimed that she had chosen to resign. This is false.

12/17/20, 11:35 PM - V: Random seed
12/17/20, 11:38 PM - +91 83558 14130: Haan that determines how your data is shuffled
12/17/20, 11:38 PM - +91 83558 14130: if used is split function
12/17/20, 11:40 PM - +91 83558 14130: Aur Cross Val mein tab cross cal ka data kaise shuffle/folds mein ho raha hai woh randomize karta hai
12/17/20, 11:40 PM - V: ek second when we used train_test_split with shuffle on
12/17/20, 11:41 PM - V: that does it automatically doesn't it
12/17/20, 11:41 PM - V: ?
12/18/20, 1:10 AM - Arijit: Random seed is basically tera starting value. Jaise maan le ki Gaussian distribution se tu random numbers generate kr rha hai toh initial ek value deni padegi
12/18/20, 1:10 AM - Arijit: Like tu bina seed define kiye karega toh current unix epoch as a seed jata hai
12/18/20, 1:11 AM - V: Ok so abhi tak ek seed bas ek starting value hai
12/18/20, 1:11 AM - Arijit: Ji
12/18/20, 1:14 AM - V: Kyunki usne bola seed karne se random values ko result nahi change hote

12/19/20, 3:37 PM - Rishabh: Things I think we shoud focus on to do this, post any suggestions here: 
1. We have ~260 fully annotated ones and around 2000 to go in to_add table; Move the hyperlinks from to_add --> main annotate all the we have a lot of backlog there anyone who wants to help out there just directly edit and add your name as a contributor there.
2. Suggestions on improving the workflow, ie. Currently AIrtable form
12/19/20, 3:38 PM - Rishabh: Edit link for to_add: https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inv1BakdMVZ6MeAT1&inviteToken=41f964e28cc91fdf2c072cca155bcf19556fb9ccf8b6430cd42e8e5476428c4f

Our friends from in3D.io released their app for digitizing humans with simple UX ‚Äî just with a single scan of 360 turn. They use TrueDepth camera in iPhones to get photoreal quality.

Avatar is auto-rigged, there are a bunch of funny animations available in the app. You can export the model to a file, GTA V or Second Life.

Looking forward to Fortnite integration after Epic Games solve their issues!

3/20/21, 10:04 AM - +91 78939 07417: because, if we are talking about loss from the original gradient, it is always optimal to take n dimensions. but it hurts the speed.
3/20/21, 10:04 AM - +91 83558 14130: ?
3/20/21, 10:04 AM - +91 78939 07417: Moreover, any optimization you can think of is probabilistic because I can always give you a gradient that points towards a standard basis vector and you will never be able to reconstruct it using any other vector

3/20/21, 10:04 AM - +91 78939 07417: even if you take all the n-1 basis vectors
3/20/21, 10:04 AM - +91 83558 14130: Aisi puch raha tha
3/20/21, 10:04 AM - +91 78939 07417: yea, keeping d low results in randomness in the gradient, and the power of the evolution algos lie in the fact that the initial population is large. even if some of them get stuck in some global minima, the randomness in gradient assures that most of them don't.

3/20/21, 3:53 AM - Rishabh: Great read @917893907417 I don't think I got the part of the reconstruction of ~gradient from just sampling d dim derivatives.
3/20/21, 4:06 AM - Rishabh: It makes sense to calculate only some derivatives, did you guys think about any optimizations for nos of derivatives being calculated?
3/20/21, 4:14 AM - Rishabh: https://github.com/slinderman/stats320
3/20/21, 4:15 AM - Rishabh: Btw do you know anyone who has a good technical blog? Preferably a student?
3/20/21, 4:23 AM - Rishabh: Yeah, its compute intensive and will differ case-by-case, I was thinking as you are taking d<n and have a ~ value most of the time the the gradient approx would result in a evolution which not a global minima.
3/20/21, 4:24 AM - Rishabh: Yeah we need all n to reconstruct perfectly, got that.
3/20/21, 4:26 AM - Rishabh: Yeah I follow her blog, one of the best!
3/20/21, 4:29 AM - Rishabh: Yeah makes sense, one simple idea that comes to mind is having an inverse corellation b/w population size and d, thus computing more precise approximations as the in the later evolutions.
3/20/21, 4:29 AM - Rishabh: *generations
3/20/21, 4:30 AM - Rishabh: not evolutions.
3/20/21, 4:30 AM - Rishabh: I see nice.

3/21/21, 12:24 AM - Rishabh: Interesting I participated in the Deepracer Challenge AWS , and the JPL challenege for rover navigation we essentially used DRL+ some other stat methods for all, do similar statergies work for Arial navigation as well?
3/21/21, 12:42 AM - +91 77719 90764: New v1.5 of datasets is out  https://huggingface.co/datasets

3/21/21, 12:47 AM - Rishabh: Always a pleasur.
3/21/21, 12:47 AM - Rishabh: OS ready to boot yet @919717945717
3/21/21, 12:50 AM - +91 78939 07417: they can, only the state space might be larger
3/21/21, 12:52 AM - +91 78939 07417: but rover is holonomic right?
3/21/21, 12:52 AM - Rishabh: Yeah and I believe the DOF being larger would also result in a larger action space right?
3/21/21, 12:52 AM - +91 78939 07417: yea
3/21/21, 12:52 AM - Rishabh: Yeah
3/21/21, 12:53 AM - +91 78939 07417: and car is not, so I think you must have used different strategies in both of these?
3/21/21, 12:53 AM - Rishabh: Yes
3/21/21, 12:54 AM - Rishabh: DRL, SLAM, one used classical CV since we had the I/P of the cameras.
3/21/21, 12:55 AM - +91 78939 07417: SLAM is not for control right? I didn't get you
3/21/21, 12:57 AM - Rishabh: No for mapping perception-action; so in one of them we had sensor readings which had thresholds which you are penalised for if you cross, so for planning using the sensor data..
3/21/21, 1:01 AM - Rishabh: I'll send you our technical report on that if you want to have a look.

3/21/21, 1:30 AM - +91 78939 07417: that is not SLAM right?
3/21/21, 1:30 AM - +91 78939 07417: SLAM is simultaneous localisation and mapping
3/21/21, 1:30 AM - +91 78939 07417: it is just localisation and mapping
3/21/21, 1:31 AM - +91 78939 07417: maybe you have used SLAM with RL to map state to action
3/21/21, 1:38 AM - Rishabh: Exactly.

3/21/21, 5:37 PM - +61 481 601 669: What about Jekyll?

Ghost is very good tho
3/21/21, 5:37 PM - Rishabh: Yeah
3/21/21, 5:38 PM - Rishabh: Yeah but more expensive than SS an academic pricing
3/21/21, 5:38 PM - +61 481 601 669: But if you want a portfolio I don't see the need for ghost simply because it's a CMS / blogging platform. Yes you can have custom CSS/js but it's more trouble than its worth
3/21/21, 5:38 PM - +61 481 601 669: Do what I do, I use bootstrap/flask on gh-pages

3/21/21, 9:15 PM - +91 83558 14130: And yes I am aware of the fact that using WSL2 was a mistake but well  I was intrigued more by how they made it happen which made me use it.
3/21/21, 9:15 PM - +91 83558 14130: In VmWare and then transitioning completely

4/2/21, 8:15 PM - +91 78689 12384: It is, I think there was some vulnerability also that came up regarding this
4/2/21, 8:15 PM - +91 83558 14130: rel to Spectre or different
4/2/21, 8:15 PM - +91 78689 12384: Not sure, have to check

4/2/21, 8:45 PM - Rishabh: how many seconds have you been using it?
4/2/21, 8:58 PM - Arijit: 164,250,000
4/2/21, 9:00 PM - Rishabh: after that if there were no bugs there prolly might be MS-DOS
4/2/21, 9:01 PM - Arijit: Umm I clearly remember it had a gui
4/2/21, 9:04 PM - Rishabh: Definitely  Windows 1 then
4/2/21, 9:07 PM - V: I think that's just turning away from the problem agar ankhe band karlega kabootar to billi thodi gayab hojaegi
4/2/21, 9:07 PM - Rishabh: lol
4/2/21, 9:08 PM - Rishabh: The updates sizes are as big as a unix based OS
4/2/21, 9:08 PM - Arijit: Macos update sizes are similar
4/2/21, 9:10 PM - V: Bhai macos ke updates ke baad kitni dikat aati I think you are the most experienced macos user here to ;_;
4/2/21, 9:10 PM - Rishabh: dont have to care about that things dont break after updates on mac, or restart100 times
4/2/21, 9:10 PM - Arijit: I agree
4/2/21, 9:10 PM - Rishabh: Aati hai?
4/2/21, 9:11 PM - Arijit: Na nahi aati
4/2/21, 9:11 PM - V: Mai pooch raha hoon
4/2/21, 9:11 PM - Rishabh: exactly
4/2/21, 9:11 PM - Rishabh: update ke pehle aur bad no problem
4/2/21, 9:11 PM - V: Exactly
4/2/21, 9:11 PM - Arijit: Uska reason is mac ko pata hai apna hardware
Tum windows use karo with surface toh dikkat nahi aayegi
4/2/21, 9:11 PM - Rishabh: the new m1 hs some memory leak issues bas
4/2/21, 9:12 PM - Rishabh: Have used, aata hai.
4/2/21, 9:12 PM - Arijit: When you have 50 different vendors providing 100 different devices then it's difficult to provide a seamless update
4/2/21, 9:12 PM - V: Surface geniunely ek gen peeche lagta hai mujhe windows ultrabooks mei bhi
4/2/21, 9:13 PM - V: 3 surface laptops no variant with a thunderbolt
4/2/21, 9:13 PM - Rishabh: The end consumer does not care.
4/2/21, 9:13 PM - Arijit: Tbh India me thunderbolt is pretty useless
4/2/21, 9:13 PM - V: Instead we give you Surface connector üôÇ
4/2/21, 9:13 PM - Rishabh: whaaat
4/2/21, 9:13 PM - Arijit: Yep
4/2/21, 9:14 PM - Rishabh: I have been using it for last 2 years
4/2/21, 9:14 PM - Rishabh: There is nothing better
4/2/21, 9:14 PM - Arijit: Aisa kya use hai jo usb c nahi kr skta?
4/2/21, 9:14 PM - V: Every windows premium ultrabook has a thunderbolt that's the quality of life improvement we get when we pay the premium
4/2/21, 9:14 PM - Rishabh: eGPU
4/2/21, 9:14 PM - +91 87088 21604: I think linux run on 100x hardware than Windows and it's just seamless
4/2/21, 9:14 PM - Arijit: Read this again
4/2/21, 9:14 PM - Rishabh: video o/p and i/o speed
4/2/21, 9:15 PM - Rishabh: I live in India lol
4/2/21, 9:15 PM - Arijit: India me egpu  nahi hai

4/2/21, 9:15 PM - Arijit: Na bhai
4/2/21, 9:15 PM - Rishabh: you can but it
4/2/21, 9:15 PM - Rishabh: I have a core X.
4/2/21, 9:15 PM - Arijit: I can but it'll cost more than the gpu
4/2/21, 9:16 PM - +91 87088 21604: LmaoüòÇüòÇ

So true
4/2/21, 9:16 PM - Rishabh: yes but there are benefits you can chnge gpu+ laptop separately
4/2/21, 9:16 PM - V: India me chal mei maanleta thunderbolt is useless then explain who uses the surface connector
4/2/21, 9:16 PM - Arijit: Yaar surface connector ko useful nahi bola mei üòÇ
4/2/21, 9:16 PM - Rishabh: You can build a PCI-3 to thunderbolt bridge and case for a fraction of the cost.
4/2/21, 9:17 PM - Rishabh: whats. a surface connector lol
4/2/21, 9:17 PM - Arijit: You'll not get authentic parts for that
4/2/21, 9:17 PM - +91 87088 21604: I don't have anyreason to ise gpu ü•¥

4/2/21, 9:17 PM - V: An excuse by Microsoft for doing something different
4/2/21, 9:18 PM - Rishabh: bhai sab chaheye.
4/2/21, 9:18 PM - V: Again microsoft does ship thunderbolt port in surface go
4/2/21, 9:18 PM - V: But pentium gold üôÇ
4/2/21, 9:18 PM - Arijit: Apple gives 3.5mm in laptops but not in phones
4/2/21, 9:18 PM - Rishabh: yes there are other benefits as well dual 4k channels
4/2/21, 9:19 PM - Arijit: Usb c supports that with data and power pass through
4/2/21, 9:19 PM - V: Because they are choosers and other are followers
4/2/21, 9:19 PM - +91 87088 21604: They need space in mobile üòÇ
4/2/21, 9:19 PM - +91 87088 21604: Slower than thunderbolt
4/2/21, 9:20 PM - Arijit: You'll not get nas storages in India :)
4/2/21, 9:20 PM - V: Jo design choice apple choose karta hai android side pe ache se ripoff hota hai

4/2/21, 9:21 PM - Rishabh: See the becnhmarks.
4/2/21, 9:21 PM - V: And notch too
4/2/21, 9:21 PM - V: Nobody loves notch
4/2/21, 9:21 PM - Rishabh: where do you get this info I have a NAS
4/2/21, 9:21 PM - Arijit: And _notches_ too
4/2/21, 9:21 PM - Arijit: Which one?
4/2/21, 9:21 PM - V: But now it's a design statement
4/2/21, 9:22 PM - Rishabh: No but that was for faceID cams
4/2/21, 9:22 PM - Arijit: Samsung did that in 2016 wo an ugly design
4/2/21, 9:22 PM - Arijit: And they had the fp scanner too
4/2/21, 9:22 PM - V: And jab apple didn't change notch for something new the entire industry ripped the distant second Samsung and their punchhole
4/2/21, 9:23 PM - Rishabh: Yes samsung can do it 10 years in advance with a shitty implmentation iris scanner and what not but when apple launches it it launches after perfecting the tech.
4/2/21, 9:24 PM - Arijit: Having used the note 7 i can confirm iris scanner wasn't shitty
4/2/21, 9:24 PM - +91 87088 21604: It's something they called retina scan same IR but no 3D projector
4/2/21, 9:24 PM - Arijit: Iria
4/2/21, 9:24 PM - +91 87088 21604: I used it in S9
4/2/21, 9:24 PM - +91 87088 21604: Ha wahi
4/2/21, 9:25 PM - V: Yes I still wonder how you survived the blast
4/2/21, 9:25 PM - Arijit: Nope it scans the iris and not a 3d holographic (i suppose) of the face
4/2/21, 9:25 PM - +91 87088 21604: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
4/2/21, 9:25 PM - Rishabh: Its actually not if you read about the philosophy they want to move the market forward, look into the history of the 3.5mm
4/2/21, 9:25 PM - Arijit: The same way my macbook keyboard didn't fail
4/2/21, 9:25 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yes it just scan the eye ball and even work in total dark
4/2/21, 9:25 PM - Rishabh: compare it to faceID tech which is absolutely revolutionary, even MSFT aknowledged it
4/2/21, 9:26 PM - V: I haven't encountered any problems with butterfly it was nice
4/2/21, 9:26 PM - +91 87088 21604: It's even in Airports ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
4/2/21, 9:26 PM - +91 78689 12384: What's so bad about 3.5 mm jack
4/2/21, 9:26 PM - V: Thin keys with less travel resulting in clicky sound was addicting
4/2/21, 9:27 PM - Rishabh: what faceID?
4/2/21, 9:27 PM - Rishabh: Yes I liked it
4/2/21, 9:27 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yes
4/2/21, 9:27 PM - +91 78689 12384: Afaik that their intention was to popularize wireless, I just don't agree with that decision
4/2/21, 9:27 PM - +91 78689 12384: Nothing wrong with 3.5mm imo, USB type c or lightning is a downgrade for the end user
4/2/21, 9:27 PM - Rishabh: nooo please
4/2/21, 9:28 PM - Rishabh: any source?
4/2/21, 9:28 PM - Rishabh: The 3.5mm jack is over 50-years-old tech man.
4/2/21, 9:28 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yes we're ahead to a generation of complete wireless..
Maybe after a couple of year there would be a portless phone
4/2/21, 9:28 PM - +91 78689 12384: Just because it's old doesn't mean it needs to be replaced...
4/2/21, 9:28 PM - +91 78689 12384: It doesn't have any obvious downsides
4/2/21, 9:28 PM - Rishabh: Yes it does.
4/2/21, 9:29 PM - +91 78689 12384: What's the downside?

4/2/21, 9:29 PM - Rishabh: Has not improved either 50 years
4/2/21, 9:29 PM - +91 78689 12384: It doesn't need improvement :), the wired alternatives don't provide an improvement either afaik
4/2/21, 9:30 PM - V: I would still prefer wired but some of the true wireless earbuds from sony are a good replacement
4/2/21, 9:30 PM - +91 78689 12384: I don't see any issue that 3.5mm jack poses
4/2/21, 9:30 PM - +91 87088 21604: Wired OP
4/2/21, 9:30 PM - Arijit: Even dacs use 3.5mm
4/2/21, 9:30 PM - Rishabh: Man you know that facial recog is not what we are talkign about its faceID tech is different,.
4/2/21, 9:30 PM - Rishabh: Yes for the time being.
4/2/21, 9:31 PM - Rishabh: This year there is a redesign of the lineup.
4/2/21, 9:31 PM - +91 87088 21604: Concept is same i totally against it..
It intrudes privacy
4/2/21, 9:32 PM - Rishabh: Thats an ignorant belif
4/2/21, 9:32 PM - +91 87088 21604: Ok why so?
4/2/21, 9:33 PM - Arijit: As someone who has used ThinkPad keyboards, the butterfly keyboard was just little bit better that my phones keyboard
4/2/21, 9:34 PM - +91 87088 21604: It's just a very very powerful tool for mass spying
4/2/21, 9:34 PM - Rishabh: Thinkpad is a beast!
4/2/21, 9:34 PM - Arijit: Was*
4/2/21, 9:34 PM - Arijit: New ones are shit
4/2/21, 9:34 PM - Rishabh: Facebook is a powerful .....
4/2/21, 9:34 PM - V: ThinkPad had the best keyboards no cap but apple had good keyboards.
4/2/21, 9:34 PM - Rishabh: include whatsapp, insta etc lol
4/2/21, 9:35 PM - Rishabh: Carbon is good I thought?
4/2/21, 9:35 PM - Arijit: Was
4/2/21, 9:35 PM - +91 87088 21604: Sadly,Yesss :(
4/2/21, 9:35 PM - Arijit: The last great ThinkPad was *70 series
4/2/21, 9:35 PM - Arijit: 2017-18
4/2/21, 9:36 PM - V: Lmao we live in an age where user clicks are counted as data for recommender systems
4/2/21, 9:36 PM - Rishabh: I see, I saw the reviews for the new carbon x1 looked good.
4/2/21, 9:36 PM - V: And we count faceid as intrusion in privacy
4/2/21, 9:36 PM - Rishabh: yeah
4/2/21, 9:36 PM - Rishabh: so what?
4/2/21, 9:36 PM - Arijit: I've used them personally
4/2/21, 9:36 PM - Rishabh: you think whatsapp is free?
4/2/21, 9:36 PM - Rishabh: oh how was it?
4/2/21, 9:36 PM - Arijit: Almost all components are soldered
4/2/21, 9:36 PM - +91 87088 21604: It's more of social control  than social media
4/2/21, 9:36 PM - +91 87088 21604: More than half of the worlds population use Facebook
4/2/21, 9:36 PM - Arijit: Bad audio, screen for the price
4/2/21, 9:37 PM - V: Nope I was just stating the point that user privacy is a superficial term
4/2/21, 9:37 PM - Rishabh: yeah not knowing that all of the data is processed locally so I don't see how that intrudes your pricacy @918708821604

4/2/21, 9:38 PM - Rishabh: SO they mine data--> invation of privacy
4/2/21, 9:38 PM - +91 87088 21604: Atleast WhatsApp still uses signal encryption.
Its good
4/2/21, 9:39 PM - Arijit: Nope you can replace almost everything in the x260-270
4/2/21, 9:39 PM - Rishabh: Oh
4/2/21, 9:39 PM - Rishabh: ?
4/2/21, 9:39 PM - Arijit: And no one wants a thin laptop if they're buying a ThinkPad

4/2/21, 9:43 PM - Arijit: Nice one
4/2/21, 9:43 PM - +91 78689 12384: I mean as long as you claim what Whatsapp doesn' have E2E, one can also "claim" that Apple doesn't process data locally...
4/2/21, 9:43 PM - Rishabh: Thatsa. verifiable fact.
4/2/21, 9:44 PM - Rishabh: E2E is more like a joke where you scan a QR code lol
4/2/21, 9:44 PM - +91 78689 12384: How so?
4/2/21, 9:44 PM - +91 87088 21604: Why so?

You got your keys!!
4/2/21, 9:45 PM - +91 78689 12384: You can't possibly claim that there is no way that Apple couldn't be sending data in the background
4/2/21, 9:45 PM - +91 78689 12384: it is a non falsifiable claim just like it cannot be proven or disproven that Whatsapp doesn't use E2E
4/2/21, 9:47 PM - V: At this current point of time it's more like a catalogue of the company which you want to allow your data access to.
4/2/21, 9:47 PM - Rishabh: It is ready about their T1 arch or how they store infor for password unlock
4/2/21, 9:47 PM - V: Would you like facebook to rob your data or you want Google to
4/2/21, 9:48 PM - Rishabh: Thats the reason they cannot unloack any Iphone, instance that terrorist thing that happened
4/2/21, 9:48 PM - V: The choice is yours üôè

4/2/21, 9:50 PM - +91 78689 12384: As long as you go down the conspiracy theory route, everything is deniable :P, you can claim that there is no way to know whethaer it was a big PR stunt and info was actually shared on the down low, or that they have a secret undisclosed backdoor
4/2/21, 9:50 PM - +91 78689 12384: I mean you're essentially claiming that a company (Facebook) doesn't have what it is claiming to have, same argument can be applied to Apple, who knows whether there are intentional backdoors in how they "store" their keys
4/2/21, 9:50 PM - Arijit: They failed because they failed to embrace the changes like a proper application store

And also the fact you needed to have a separate plan from your provider if you wanted to use internet on your BB
4/2/21, 9:51 PM - V: Legit their hardware was cool

4/2/21, 9:52 PM - +91 78689 12384: That's the point, that technology may be legitimate but how do you know they are actually using it? Or using a non backdoored version of it? That's where it comes in the realm of opinion
4/2/21, 9:52 PM - +91 78689 12384: Similar to how E2E tech is well known
4/2/21, 9:52 PM - +91 78689 12384: And scrutinized by researchers
4/2/21, 9:53 PM - V: Its more like everything is fine until you aren't caught
4/2/21, 9:53 PM - +91 78689 12384: But the claim here is that E2E isn't used at all isn't it?
4/2/21, 9:53 PM - +91 78689 12384: So taking the same lines of argument, I can claim that their hardware enclave isn't used at all..
4/2/21, 9:53 PM - V: Would huawei have been banned if they weren't using backdoors
4/2/21, 9:54 PM - V: Or were never caught using it
4/2/21, 9:54 PM - +91 87088 21604: Simple just grab source and run on your services if you don't trust any company.

I trust signal they are Foss you can check code anytime.
The people governing them are great.
You can grab code and check it make fork make your services
4/2/21, 9:55 PM - +91 78689 12384: That is true, my point was more regarding if you suspect Whatsapp for security lapses then other companies can also be suspected
4/2/21, 9:55 PM - V: The downside on that thing is end user support is poor
4/2/21, 9:56 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yah but just use what you trust..
4/2/21, 9:56 PM - +91 78689 12384: You got to pick some level of trust for closed source software, so you believe that E2E is there or that the hardware enclave doesn't have obvious backdoors
4/2/21, 9:56 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yahh!! :(
4/2/21, 9:56 PM - V: Not every one are developers
4/2/21, 9:56 PM - Arijit: But sadly others don't use what I trust :(

Matrix is great alternative to discord but everyone refuses it. :(
4/2/21, 9:57 PM - Rishabh: I'll not waste my time on creating hypothetical senarios, I've real the papers, T1 chips arch, aptents security reports if someone does not trust those Idk what to day lol
4/2/21, 9:57 PM - +91 78689 12384: network effects go brr
4/2/21, 9:57 PM - Arijit: There's this thing called "on papers"
4/2/21, 9:58 PM - +91 78689 12384: lmalmao it was you who suggested the hypothetical scenario of Whatsapp not using E2E
4/2/21, 9:58 PM - +91 78689 12384: There is just as much research on the efficacy of E2E
4/2/21, 9:58 PM - Rishabh: I never said it does not use E2E
4/2/21, 9:58 PM - +91 78689 12384: Then what was your point? That E2E is insecure? I don
4/2/21, 9:58 PM - +91 87088 21604: Actually they do signal claims it too
4/2/21, 10:04 PM - Rishabh: idk but I probably wont send my bank acc details on whatsapp.
4/2/21, 10:05 PM - +91 78689 12384: see now that's the irrationality..you're willing to believe that Apple is secure because of published research but aren't willing to do the same for Facebook when there's also literature on E2E...
4/2/21, 10:06 PM - +91 87088 21604: I did send them email regarding that and they claimed we don't take any data of yours üòÇüòÇ
4/2/21, 10:06 PM - Rishabh: E2E has lietrature whatsapp E2E does not Apple encryption has patents which shows its implementation thats a huge difference.
4/2/21, 10:07 PM - Rishabh: Its like comparing AES math pubs. with the apple patents.
4/2/21, 10:07 PM - +91 78689 12384: If Whatsapp says it uses Signal E2E and Signal E2E has literature, I would say that Whatsapp encryption is also well vetted.
4/2/21, 10:10 PM - Rishabh: ok
4/2/21, 10:11 PM - +91 87088 21604: E2E is over. just boycott Amazon Facebook Google Microsoft Apple.
4/2/21, 10:13 PM - Rishabh: I'm ok with all companies takign my data.

4/5/21, 3:15 PM - V: Deepmind
4/5/21, 3:16 PM - V: Android is open source at core
4/5/21, 3:16 PM - +91 87088 21604: Na wo to becha tha uske dev ne shyd not sure tho
4/5/21, 3:16 PM - V: But Google Mobile service are proprietary
4/5/21, 3:16 PM - +91 87088 21604: Ha wahi
4/5/21, 3:16 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yess firebase gsm gsf gcs proprietary shitt
4/5/21, 3:16 PM - +91 78689 12384: Wasn't it made open source after Google
4/5/21, 3:16 PM - +91 87088 21604: And their SDKs
4/5/21, 3:16 PM - +91 78689 12384: And wasn't there a shift towards more closed source components in Android
4/5/21, 3:17 PM - V: Google Mobile services are pretty much closed source they have employees to pay money to
4/5/21, 3:17 PM - +91 87088 21604: OEM drivers and application are proprietary .
Android can't be proprietary coz kernel's license is GPL.
They can get sued
4/5/21, 3:17 PM - +91 87088 21604: If they do so

4/5/21, 3:18 PM - V: Thats why huawei has its own proprietary service call Huawei mobile core
4/5/21, 3:18 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yess all in all there practices are same
4/5/21, 3:19 PM - V: But are still running Android
4/5/21, 3:20 PM - +91 87088 21604: Google plays a good game and use their customer as test bed for chromium in name of FOSS
4/5/21, 3:21 PM - +91 78689 12384: This is all in principle, has the validity of this license ever been established in court? I think these licenses are sounding good in theory but the reality of taking on an organisation like Google with  their deep pockets won't really work out imo..not sure thoufh
4/5/21, 3:21 PM - +91 87088 21604: Even some security researchers and many devs contribute to it
4/5/21, 3:21 PM - +91 87088 21604: Noo..
Recent year amazon get sued by Open Source foundation
4/5/21, 3:21 PM - +91 78689 12384: Will read on it
4/5/21, 3:22 PM - V: If everything had to work like that  linux would have been purchased by Microsoft at that time only
4/5/21, 3:22 PM - +91 87088 21604: Google plays a very nice game by licensing their products under BSD-Clause licenses
4/5/21, 3:22 PM - +91 78689 12384: What?
4/5/21, 3:22 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yahhh!!!

4/5/21, 3:25 PM - +91 87088 21604: They still hold power no one can use any product commercially licensed under GPL and other permissive licenses
4/5/21, 3:25 PM - +91 87088 21604: They have lawsuit..
4/5/21, 3:25 PM - Mehul Srivastava: I mean if you use their code in some closed source thing

4/5/21, 3:25 PM - +91 87088 21604: Your repo still holding on github
4/5/21, 3:25 PM - +91 78689 12384: That's the point...in the real world it does not matter enouugh to be correct, it also matters about who has more funds. If the lawsuit is long and protracted and the suing organization doesn't have  the funds to cover the legal fees...
4/5/21, 3:25 PM - +91 87088 21604: Pta chljata elf and bin se

If you prefer video
4/5/21, 3:32 PM - +91 87088 21604: Even apple contribute to linux because they use some part of it.
And they still do maintain Darwin kernel as same which was fork of UNIX kernel
4/5/21, 3:32 PM - V: Macos is fork of free Bsd lmao
4/5/21, 3:32 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Open*
4/5/21, 3:32 PM - V: M1 is based on Arm instruction set
4/5/21, 3:33 PM - +91 87088 21604: Google made chromium OS licensed under GPL coz it's base is gentoo
4/5/21, 3:33 PM - +91 87088 21604: No they started it as a base.
No one can beat UNIX
4/5/21, 3:34 PM - V: Fu nintendo I play super tux cart
4/5/21, 3:38 PM - +91 78689 12384: This seems to be  more  about how Elastic changed its licensing to be more restrictive. And I guess Amazon complied by creating its own fork of Elastic so the status quo did not change. My point was slightly different, it was that it seems that all these open source licenses till now rely on the company's goodwill to step clear of them. If some large company decides to dispute the validity of this license, whether they're correct or not, I don't think there's a representative of these licenses who can bear that legal cost to go against them. My only point was that a precedent does not seem to be established in court, though companies seem to be abiding by it so I guess your point is valid
4/5/21, 3:40 PM - +91 78689 12384: Though I find it a bit confusing about which parts exactly are to be open sourced. If they use the kernel and call inti a proprietary API, does the proprietary API also need to be open sourced? How can  there be closed and  open source components in a system when glue code links them together,  does it mean that all of the  code must be open sourced?
4/5/21, 3:41 PM - +91 87088 21604: Fun fact..
Oracle sued Google in Court of California for copyright infringement
4/5/21, 3:42 PM - +91 87088 21604: Inti?
4/5/21, 3:42 PM - V: Init
4/5/21, 3:42 PM - V: Or maybe into*
4/5/21, 3:42 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yes, for their APIs and won, but that was a long drawn lawsuit and Oracle is a large company. Who is Linux's representative?
4/5/21, 3:42 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yea
4/5/21, 3:43 PM - +91 87088 21604: Broooooo
Linux is a very huge foundation..
Torvals own the copyright
4/5/21, 3:45 PM - +91 78689 12384: I'm aware. Funded mostly by the very private companies who are supposed to uphold these licenses...
Regardless, where's an ooen source project like Homebrew or something else that is in the realm of very big but lacking major funds supposed to go to to enforce its licenses
4/5/21, 3:45 PM - +91 78689 12384: It gets $6-7 million per year
4/5/21, 3:45 PM - +91 78689 12384: In funding
4/5/21, 3:46 PM - +91 78689 12384: I assume significant chunks would be used up in routine activities
4/5/21, 3:46 PM - +91 78689 12384: Leaving much less for a legal battle
4/5/21, 3:46 PM - +91 87088 21604: For example in android Google use linux kernel which is licensed under GPLv2.
So they've to make it open source on top of it they can use whatever they want because they're using only kernel same with apple they still do contribute to both kernels
4/5/21, 3:48 PM - +91 78689 12384: The license asks you to make derivatives open source, correct? Isn't the definition of a derivative a grey area? What if they have a huge proprietary kernel module which they call into from their ooen source kernel code. They can claim that this is not a part of the kernel, correct? And so they don't have to open source it? Isn't this how proprietary blobs are a thing?
4/5/21, 3:49 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yahh!! Those capitalist holds power but courts exist to do justice, to guarantee liberty, to enhance social order, to resolve disputes, to maintain the rule of law, to provide for equal protection to all.
4/5/21, 3:50 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yes even firefox have blobs in name of pocket
4/5/21, 3:50 PM - +91 87088 21604: Even if you use linux on day to day bases
4/5/21, 3:51 PM - +91 87088 21604: You do have some binary blobs too
4/5/21, 3:52 PM - +91 87088 21604: Like my Qualcomm atheros wifi driver are proprietary i have to use them i don't know what they're doing in background but i can supress that using cgroup and other things
4/5/21, 3:54 PM - +91 87088 21604: And all of those big giants maintain their own linux distros for there cloud computing but they don't have same licenses coz they're not using that product commercially

4/6/21, 10:58 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yeah from their CS 70 course. I had come across this some months back..it is about how you can recover from k bit errors and relies on your data being stored in the coefficients of the polynomial which is then reconstructed at the receiving end
4/6/21, 10:58 PM - +91 78689 12384: I haven't seen all of their CS 70 notes but this one I had looked  into
4/6/21, 10:59 PM - +91 83558 14130: Rel to CRC?

4/6/21, 11:00 PM - +91 78689 12384: No, I think CRC is just a checksum, it will only tell you about corruption, it won't allow you to reconstruct the original unmarred data
4/6/21, 11:03 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yeah these were more along those lines, though I guess the theory is different, this is based on  polynomial reconstruction while hamming is based on adding extra parity bits as far as I recall
4/6/21, 11:03 PM - +91 78689 12384: A bit fuzzy in my memory though

4/7/21, 10:06 PM - +91 78689 12384: Possibly don't see the value of directing resources to 1% of the market of which even lesser may buy Photoshop....
4/7/21, 10:06 PM - +91 87088 21604: You're wrong Krita GIMP is better than Adobe
Adobe already know that
4/7/21, 10:07 PM - V: Linux was 1%
4/7/21, 10:07 PM - V: When windows was 95%
4/7/21, 10:08 PM - V: Now windows has approx 82% market share thanks to windows 10 being a mess
4/7/21, 10:08 PM - +91 78689 12384: Could be so..but main drivers of revenue are graphic  studios the vastt majority off which will be running windows / mac.. what's even the point of porting
4/7/21, 10:08 PM - +91 78689 12384: I assume Macos is the gap because I haven't heard Linux occupying >10% on rhe Desktop...
4/7/21, 10:09 PM - V: Not 1 percent it's greater than that about 2-4 percent maybe
4/7/21, 10:09 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yah but tbh linux user don't need Adobe
4/7/21, 10:09 PM - V: Why not
4/7/21, 10:09 PM - +91 78689 12384: still the point stands
4/7/21, 10:09 PM - +91 78689 12384: It doesn't make any finanncial sense to port imo
4/7/21, 10:10 PM - V: Infact I need it the most after probably visual studio ide
4/7/21, 10:10 PM - +91 87088 21604: We have GIMP Krita üòå
4/7/21, 10:10 PM - V: Figma is cool tho
4/7/21, 10:11 PM - +91 87088 21604: You know what writing software for linux is comparatively easier than Windows
4/7/21, 10:11 PM - +91 78689 12384: Even if they're better, unless you're a freelancer / just doing design independently,  it  is in your best interest to learn Photoshop, no?
4/7/21, 10:11 PM - V: It doesn't matter if it doesn't give you money he is right actually
4/7/21, 10:11 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yessss Blender too
4/7/21, 10:12 PM - +91 78689 12384: so? To port a codebase to Linux, significan effort would be needed, Linux could be 10x easier but they'll go where the money is

4/7/21, 10:14 PM - V: Maybe proprietary support does help in certain things
4/7/21, 10:14 PM - V: Everyone isn't a developer who would reverse engineer the software ig
4/7/21, 10:15 PM - V: So let the people who are good at it handle it
4/7/21, 10:15 PM - +91 78689 12384: heck most developers who go on about open source don't really look at the code or even modify it significantly...
4/7/21, 10:15 PM - +91 87088 21604: But zathura is better than adobe pdfüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

4/7/21, 10:16 PM - +91 78689 12384: probably 1  in 1000 people who claim that Linux is great because it is open source and you can learn actually look at the source code or modify it
4/7/21, 10:16 PM - V: Open source works the same way too only with the option of transparency
4/7/21, 10:16 PM - V: If you need to look at the code it's there
4/7/21, 10:16 PM - +91 78689 12384: My point is that most developers do not really make use of software being open source
4/7/21, 10:16 PM - +91 87088 21604: Maybe
4/7/21, 10:17 PM - V: Choice is there na
4/7/21, 10:17 PM - +91 87088 21604: But most dev related to linux and foss do code as hobby
4/7/21, 10:17 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yes, I'm not disagreeing with you
4/7/21, 10:17 PM - +91 78689 12384: Choice is good
4/7/21, 10:17 PM - +91 78689 12384: But rarely is it used is all I'm saying
4/7/21, 10:18 PM - V: The person has to be skilled enough to improve it
4/7/21, 10:18 PM - V: Thats the line ig
4/7/21, 10:18 PM - +91 87088 21604: Actually kernel is like 2M+ line sloc..

4/9/21, 7:18 PM - V: Yes personally used it
4/9/21, 7:18 PM - V: Very efficient
4/9/21, 7:19 PM - V: @919082216009 let us put enough resources to get featured in an episode of game theorists
4/9/21, 8:08 PM - +91 87088 21604: I'm waiting it to be implemented
4/9/21, 8:10 PM - +91 78689 12384: IIRC it is running out of steam, they spent a lot of time implementing an innovative and elegant CRDT based architecture for correctness in distributed editing but I guess it didn't work out or something, there was a post by Ralph
4/9/21, 8:11 PM - +91 78689 12384: https://raphlinus.github.io/xi/2020/06/27/xi-retrospective.html
4/9/21, 8:11 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yea here it is
4/9/21, 8:12 PM - +91 87088 21604: Don't know much about it but i tried Tau, a GUI-frontend for Xi. My experience was good with it.
But it's no where near vim or kakoune.
It's just a backend like vim-runtime for vim
4/9/21, 8:12 PM - +91 78689 12384: I haven't used it either, just read articles about it, found it very fascinating

:s/pattern/to_replace_with/g


Put % before 's' to replace all matches


About multiple cursors, there's a plugin
4/9/21, 9:40 PM - +91 78689 12384: yeah I know for the same file..I'm talking about when you're in a directory and you want to do it acros a project
4/9/21, 9:40 PM - +91 87088 21604: I used it just a little
4/9/21, 9:40 PM - +91 87088 21604: Then i would use grep like a pro with sed or just independently awk
4/9/21, 9:41 PM - +91 78689 12384: hmm seems cumbersome for a fairly simple operation
4/9/21, 9:41 PM - +91 87088 21604: It's easy as above mention command its same as vim
4/9/21, 9:42 PM - +91 78689 12384: what's the command?
4/9/21, 9:42 PM - +91 78689 12384: for doing globally
4/9/21, 9:43 PM - +91 78689 12384: i mean in vscode it is just two key combinations, way faster than this so I'm seeing if there's a similarly economic way
4/9/21, 9:46 PM - Astitva: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-search-and-replace-across-multiple-files-in-vim/
4/9/21, 9:46 PM - Astitva: Just use :bufdo
4/9/21, 9:46 PM - +91 87088 21604: There's option in vim
4/9/21, 9:47 PM - +91 87088 21604: Will let u knw
4/9/21, 9:47 PM - +91 87088 21604: In dinner rn
4/9/21, 9:49 PM - +91 78689 12384: I mean yeah technically this is correct, technically we can also write a script for doing this but really I would prefer having some plugin or something with which it becomes a lot less typing, and I suppose it won't be so hard since the command can be a placeholder
4/9/21, 9:49 PM - +91 78689 12384: will look into it
4/9/21, 9:49 PM - +91 78689 12384: thanks
4/9/21, 9:50 PM - Astitva: Dude the words vim and no typing don't really go together tbvh ü§ì
4/9/21, 9:51 PM - +91 78689 12384: sure it does, vim is all about economy of keystrokes, else what's even the point of using it
4/9/21, 9:51 PM - Astitva: But it's not really difficult...just looking into the commands that work across buffers in vim you'll get a solid idea of doing anything across files and projects
4/9/21, 9:51 PM - +91 87088 21604: Hey you can do this with vim and can map key-binding in your vimrc and you can record something in vim as macro and it will repeat for you like in emacs.
4/9/21, 9:52 PM - Astitva: Yeah that works if you know vimscript well enough...I've been procrastinating about it for months üòÇüòÖ
4/9/21, 9:52 PM - +91 87088 21604: noremap <leader>p NerdTreetoggle 

I hope this is correct..
Its simple as that To bind key
4/9/21, 9:52 PM - Astitva: You could define your own plugin to suit your specific needs
4/9/21, 9:53 PM - +91 87088 21604: You can do that in lua too and that programming language is just half hour from you..



Fyi 
You don't need to learn vimL to specify bindings and all
4/9/21, 9:54 PM - Astitva: True
4/9/21, 9:54 PM - V: Settled into nano
4/9/21, 9:55 PM - Astitva: But it really comes down to what your purpose of doing this is...and honestly, efficiency of typing isn't really the same as not typing
4/9/21, 9:55 PM - +91 87088 21604: Learn vim bro do yourself a favour make your life easy
4/9/21, 9:55 PM - Rishabh: Best
4/9/21, 9:55 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yeah agree
4/9/21, 9:56 PM - V: Nano is easy learning something isn't
4/9/21, 9:56 PM - Rishabh: I don‚Äôt agree if your WPM < 80-90 not gonna matter anyway
4/9/21, 9:56 PM - Astitva: For me the whole point of using vim over anything else is to never need to leave the home row
4/9/21, 9:56 PM - +91 87088 21604: But you can't have linters lsp and all going in it under 100 mb os mem usage
4/9/21, 9:56 PM - V: I don't give a fuck about that
4/9/21, 9:57 PM - +91 87088 21604: üòÇüòÇ
4/9/21, 9:57 PM - +91 87088 21604: Bro üçª
4/9/21, 9:57 PM - +91 87088 21604: Your choice
4/9/21, 9:58 PM - +91 78689 12384: I should probably learn to type correctly first, developed a retarded typing style which yields 110 wpm but then my fingers would probably tap out soon
4/9/21, 9:58 PM - +91 78689 12384: one finger on left, three on right
4/9/21, 9:58 PM - Rishabh: Touch typing?
4/9/21, 9:59 PM - +91 78689 12384: in the sense that I type without seeing the keyboard, yes, but not the home row thing which is correct touch typing
4/9/21, 9:59 PM - V: Why does anyone count that
4/9/21, 9:59 PM - Rishabh: F
4/9/21, 9:59 PM - Astitva: I used to primarily rely on my index fingers but then unlearned and relearned everything and now it's pretty smooth with 100-110 wpm with minimal errors
4/9/21, 9:59 PM - +91 87088 21604: Speed matters
4/9/21, 9:59 PM - +91 78689 12384: because that is healthier for your fingers
4/9/21, 9:59 PM - Rishabh: Guys using mechanical?
4/9/21, 9:59 PM - V: Accuracy has more precedence
4/9/21, 10:00 PM - +91 87088 21604: But speed matters too
4/9/21, 10:00 PM - Astitva: Typing is to a coder what levitation is to a wizard lol
4/9/21, 10:00 PM - +91 78689 12384: more often than not accuracy yields speed improvements
4/9/21, 10:00 PM - Astitva: All the time.
4/9/21, 10:01 PM - V: Learning to levitate right is the key na they can't fly upside down
4/9/21, 10:01 PM - +91 87088 21604: Ohhh just stop it!!!
Use whatever you want
4/9/21, 10:02 PM - +91 87088 21604: Do whatever you upto
4/9/21, 10:02 PM - V: ü§î
4/9/21, 10:02 PM - V: Ok
4/9/21, 10:02 PM - Astitva: Make onivim free!!!!!!
4/9/21, 10:02 PM - +91 78689 12384: but yeah once you reach some basic threhold of 80 wpm, it doesn't matter that much, then it is about how well you know your shortcuts and tools
4/9/21, 10:02 PM - +91 87088 21604: It's not in my hand what i can do is just provide you binary builds for free
4/9/21, 10:02 PM - Astitva: It's all in the muscle memory

But oni2 is like out of box gateway for newbies to vim
4/9/21, 10:07 PM - Astitva: It's similar in a lot of ways to vs I think... haven't looked into it though
4/9/21, 10:07 PM - +91 78689 12384: Out of curiosity, what's wrong with Sublime? Not open source?
4/9/21, 10:07 PM - +91 87088 21604: üòÇüòÇüòÇ and what abt that buffer overflows of JS

That garbage collector is just a heap scannerü§≠ü§≠
4/9/21, 10:07 PM - Astitva: Not vim ü§≠
4/9/21, 10:08 PM - +91 78689 12384: What about sublime with vim emulation
4/9/21, 10:08 PM - Rishabh: Fuck everything VSC for life
4/9/21, 10:08 PM - Astitva: I don't really see why people prefer sublime anyway... what's the value proposition?
4/9/21, 10:09 PM - Astitva: And people do, I've seen a lot of them, out in the wild
4/9/21, 10:09 PM - +91 87088 21604: Actually we used reasonml and revery framework( made from scratch)
So yah Ui looks same but if vscode take 5 sec it take 0.5 for oni2
4/9/21, 10:09 PM - V: If you think of javascript as a word based language it makes sense
4/9/21, 10:09 PM - +91 78689 12384: very fast, solid base, batteriess loaded for the mot part. With vim emulation, can get some of the text editing niceness
4/9/21, 10:09 PM - +91 78689 12384: Tristan Hume wrote an article on why he went back to sublime
4/9/21, 10:10 PM - +91 78689 12384: I guess he tried Spaceemacs and became its top contributor
4/9/21, 10:10 PM - +91 78689 12384: and vim too I think
4/9/21, 10:10 PM - +91 78689 12384: then went back to Sublime
4/9/21, 10:10 PM - +91 78689 12384: so that may outline some reasons maybe
4/9/21, 10:10 PM - Astitva: Could you share the article

4/9/21, 10:11 PM - +91 87088 21604: I only like JS as a web language i won't like it intruding in userspace and having like half of mem taken by shitty electron and WebGL engines and others..
And cherry on top is those fuckin overfloes
4/9/21, 10:11 PM - Astitva: thanks
4/9/21, 10:11 PM - +91 87088 21604: Sublime is good competitor to VSC better than atom and very lightweight
4/9/21, 10:12 PM - +91 87088 21604: Sublime is good for any new user
4/9/21, 10:13 PM - +91 78689 12384: This guy also built his own keyboard xD

4/9/21, 10:15 PM - +91 78689 12384: Vim macros are great though
4/9/21, 10:15 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yess but not more than emacs ones

4/12/21, 8:47 AM - +91 83558 14130: I quote some random Prof from some famous video of a woman called Tibees "It is an exam of elimination"
4/12/21, 8:47 AM - V: Actually I believe basic mathematics and physics is a basic requirements for any field in Science
4/12/21, 8:48 AM - +91 83558 14130: Maths , yea but srsly Chem and shit ads management , veg why
4/12/21, 8:48 AM - V: That is aicte fault
4/12/21, 8:49 AM - +91 83558 14130: *Manipal
4/12/21, 8:49 AM - +91 83558 14130: nobody forcing them to follow it lol
4/12/21, 8:49 AM - V: They think basic moral education is required wheather you are in any field
4/12/21, 8:49 AM - +91 83558 14130: Yea , we are seeing great success with this moral education lmao
4/12/21, 8:50 AM - +91 83558 14130: lot of Geoffrey Hinton's and Karpathy's from AICTE colleges lol
4/12/21, 8:50 AM - V: Lol that's the best they can do since all technical skills barring few geniune profs is null
4/12/21, 8:51 AM - V: I know that but how much of that they actually learn here
4/12/21, 8:51 AM - V: And how much of that they do themselves is the key
4/12/21, 8:53 AM - +91 83558 14130: Lol still kuch nahi ho sakta
4/12/21, 8:55 AM - +91 83558 14130: Bruh NGL but Indian's are good at copying than innovating
4/12/21, 8:55 AM - +91 83558 14130: At least in India largely , innovation isn't supported as much
4/12/21, 8:56 AM - V: It works in this market
4/12/21, 8:56 AM - +91 83558 14130: Same goes for the systems , half assed implementation of British systems
4/12/21, 8:56 AM - V: And the government doesn't spend money on research
4/12/21, 8:56 AM - +91 83558 14130: of education, politics etc
4/12/21, 8:57 AM - V: But flaunt very gracefully when they create a sat less than gravity's budget
4/12/21, 8:57 AM - +91 83558 14130: goes to IIT, IIIT, and then into professors pocket and maybe then into some E Cell of an IIT/IIIT and then NIT
4/12/21, 8:57 AM - +91 83558 14130: Yess
4/12/21, 8:57 AM - +91 83558 14130: NGL but caste system should be abolished
4/12/21, 8:57 AM - +91 83558 14130: it jsut gives an unnecessary advantage in all sorts of exams
4/12/21, 8:58 AM - V: Yahan par logon ko vaccine nahi mil raha maharastra mei log research kya ghanta Karen
4/12/21, 8:58 AM - +91 83558 14130: Due to decades of *reservstion most DC/ST/OBC have become Crorepatis lol

4/12/21, 8:59 AM - +91 83558 14130: A good guy like us but who has reservstion goes a long long way lol
4/12/21, 8:59 AM - +91 83558 14130: Intelligence is must though
4/12/21, 8:59 AM - +91 83558 14130: I'm not talking about people who don't even have basic brain
4/12/21, 9:00 AM - V: Then they also don't take advantage of reservation generally
4/12/21, 9:00 AM - V: They are already self capable of ranking high in general category
4/12/21, 9:00 AM - V: In that case I don't mind if there's an advantage
4/12/21, 9:01 AM - V: Jaaton ko reservation do
4/12/21, 9:01 AM - V: Job mei bhi and college mei bhi
4/12/21, 9:02 AM - V: Then wait for renaming Google as jaat Google

4/12/21, 11:15 AM - Rishabh: Q from one of my friends views? "It was so surreal to watch neuralink monkey. Will one day keyboards become like this,  obsolete in general population, but still having its functions here and there ?
Or do you think there is some inherent benefits in physical control units / typing touch etc? like straining your neocortex less, needing less attention etc?  Do you know any good review article in that regard?"

4/12/21, 11:18 AM - Rishabh: <Media omitted>
4/12/21, 11:18 AM - Astitva: Analyzing the effects of continued interfacing on the brain and how it could affect cognitive functions (not necessarily adversely) is a really important proposal imo. Don't really know if we have faculties that permit such research, apart from Neuralink, in the general academia.
4/12/21, 11:21 AM - Rishabh: "We" referring to?
4/12/21, 11:22 AM - Astitva: humans
4/12/21, 11:22 AM - Rishabh: Here: Don't really know if we have faculties that permit such research, apart from Neuralink, in the general academia.
4/12/21, 11:22 AM - Astitva: faculties refer to capabilities not literal faculties lol
4/12/21, 11:23 AM - Astitva: don't know if we have techiniques available to test such effects
4/12/21, 11:23 AM - Rishabh: Oh in India not that I am aware of, outside plenty.
4/12/21, 11:24 AM - V: Do people have enough energy to think like this ?
4/12/21, 11:25 AM - Astitva: kind of obvious but interfacing is a pretty new field in general even if we include the work of neuralink, and that kind of research would take its fair share of time and resources, so idk if work on these lines have been done before or are being done today..
4/12/21, 11:25 AM - V: Oh ye keyboard use karta hoon mere neocortex pe strain kam padega

4/12/21, 11:27 AM - V: The job of biting deep in nitty gritty details is of researchers and scientists
4/12/21, 11:27 AM - Astitva: reality is a mistake. life is a mistake. space and time and nothing but mistakes
4/12/21, 11:28 AM - Rishabh: The tech which was demo'd by Neuralink has been around for ~10 years and has been demo'd @Labs around 7 years ago, its nothing new, while I believe that Neuralink certainly deserves credit for miniaturisation of the hardware but is based on decades of research an, a lot of people in the community incl. me are furious about this being a more of sales pitch, no data was shared, nothing quantitative was shared in the press-event.
4/12/21, 11:28 AM - Astitva: so no paper?
4/12/21, 11:28 AM - Rishabh: My. $0.02

4/12/21, 11:32 AM - V: Physics is the science of universe
4/12/21, 11:32 AM - Mehul Srivastava: I mean everything we see is inside our heads only :)
4/12/21, 11:33 AM - V: Mathematics is our logical observation of phenomenon
4/12/21, 11:33 AM - Astitva: and that fact/opinion is inside your head. If you couldn't observe through any of your senses, the world wouldn't exist for you.
4/12/21, 11:34 AM - V: I repeat what else would you use your brain for
4/12/21, 11:35 AM - V: What we can explain is science what we can't is myth and religion

4/12/21, 11:36 AM - V: How do you know its ice cream ?
4/12/21, 11:36 AM - Astitva: That's the thing. Reality is unknowable. There is no way to tell what's real and what isn't without basing it on assumptions, which, again, there's not way to tell the truth of.

4/12/21, 12:54 PM - +91 78689 12384: This is not really a very constructive mindset, I mean I'm in agreement about Chemistry not being a very good metric used to eliminate, but this is stepping over multiple issues:
1. Systemic: A holistic evaluation system like that available in the US is not scalable in India, and of course there is a problem of severe scarcity of quality education institutions (which takes time to fix, but not sure how much effort has been put in this directiin).
2. Exam based valuation itself isn't inherently flawed. As long as you have good questions that demonstrate your understanding of the subject, I think it is the most scalable reasonable choice you have. Are you saying that someone who scores well in the math section demonstrates no understanding at all? Looking up in the book / papers for new thing is obviously a necessity but how well do you apply / synthesize that info? Isn't that the metric that is more important? Are we really pandering to the lowest demographic of just aping an implementation?
4/12/21, 12:55 PM - V: Tell a chemistry prof that he would say ki ratna hi padhta hai chemistry mei
4/12/21, 12:56 PM - +91 78689 12384: The holistic evaluation system by itsekf has its own problems..it was introduced to keeo Jews out, now that is not a problem but at these levels of competition if you read about it students just pick uo 10s of activities they don't give a shit about just to impress admission committees
4/12/21, 12:56 PM - +91 78689 12384: Any system that exists will always be gamed
4/12/21, 12:59 PM - V: Lol I am just saying ki majority public computer science ko superior subject maanti hai engineering ke andar to why don't they evaluate on that along with physics and mathematics chemistry ka option rakh do
4/12/21, 12:59 PM - V: Doesn't that make much more sense
4/12/21, 1:00 PM - +91 78689 12384: What? How will you compare someone who scored good in  cs vs pcm?
4/12/21, 1:00 PM - V: Computer science engineers should have a basic interest in computer science and technology
4/12/21, 1:01 PM - V: P cs M and pcm
4/12/21, 1:01 PM - V: With option of cs/c
4/12/21, 1:01 PM - +91 78689 12384: Irrespective of that, how willl you rank those who do p cs m and p chemistry m against each othher
4/12/21, 1:02 PM - +91 78689 12384: Since they are all competing for the same sears
4/12/21, 1:02 PM - V: Simple deny cs branch to those without cs option in the exam
4/12/21, 1:02 PM - V: It would be very clear after that ki log kyun karte hain engineering
4/12/21, 1:04 PM - V: And also why chemistry as a subject stands useless for cs undergrads
4/12/21, 1:06 PM - +91 78689 12384: That's such a narrow minded approach that has so  many problems of its own lmao
1. When you consider that the vast majority of India is not  that economically well off and they go to great lengths to try to secure a better education.. this approach just excludes all of them  since CS is an option just in major cities, PCM is much more entrenched everywhere. This will simply exacerbate the inequalities (which are present throug the coaching business). The end goal of Indian education is the  same  as any country with a lot of poor:  to uplift poor people rather than to do worldwide research. This is simply a an option that any sane government shouldn't pick
4/12/21, 1:06 PM - +91 78689 12384: Bhai tumko ya merko CS pasand tha toh iska matlab ye nahi ki entire demographucs ko ignire karo jinko bas kisi  tara se apna plight se nikalna  he
4/12/21, 1:07 PM - +91 78689 12384: This message was deleted
4/12/21, 1:08 PM - V: Then you suggest to say that chemistry is more useful as a subject than cs in India
4/12/21, 1:08 PM - +91 78689 12384: No, I'm saying that the  existing system is too massively entrenched to  change.
4/12/21, 1:08 PM - V: People here are so money and status driven basic sciences degree from du is also useless irl
4/12/21, 1:11 PM - V: Maths and physics by their very nature are application based you get grasp on the subject by practicing the subject same is true for cs so shouldn't that ease the burden on students
4/12/21, 1:11 PM - V: Chemistry is only kept as a subject jisme ratta marke you can score high
4/12/21, 1:11 PM - V: Jab ratta hi marna hai to padhne ka kya fayda
4/12/21, 1:13 PM - +91 78689 12384: The point is that due to the decades of entrenchment the same resourced won't ve available for poor people who want to study CS, Chemistry is simply far more accessible. It sure sounds good to say that we'll evaluate branches only on subjects that are relevant to them and all that jazz but the implementation is nowhere practically feasible. It is an idealistic thing
4/12/21, 1:13 PM - V: Digital india üòÇ
4/12/21, 1:13 PM - +91 78689 12384: Sure, if you were starting from scratcy and were able to immediately deploy similar educational resources India wide immediately, then go ahead with P CS M

4/12/21, 1:14 PM - V: Considering yahan ke log are so oblivious to change
4/12/21, 1:14 PM - +91 78689 12384: Which is not a scale anyone but the CCP can think at
4/12/21, 1:16 PM - V: Autocracy is like a necessary evil india would need
4/12/21, 1:16 PM - V: In coming times
4/12/21, 1:16 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yes, good autocracy is amazing but you can never select for it..it is based on your luck
4/12/21, 1:17 PM - +91 78689 12384: I mean Singapore is the best example, they got a strong leader who believed in their country's vision
4/12/21, 1:19 PM - V: India's diversity and size makes that model difficult also considering that Politicians tend to corrupt here faster
4/12/21, 1:19 PM - V: Adding to that matter people here are blind to what is  happening around them
4/12/21, 1:21 PM - Rishabh: Bottomline PCM is a good metric to evaluate for ability in PCM
4/12/21, 1:21 PM - +91 78689 12384: I believe that wishing for a good dictator reaches the same level of whimsical imagination as: if only we were rich at the beginning, if only the government was completely free of corruption, if only competent people held their jobs this country would jump forward.
4/12/21, 1:21 PM - Rishabh: Not Comp Sci or X Engg ability.
4/12/21, 1:22 PM - V: Lol india was very rich from the start it was just a very disputed among people which made it easy to raid
4/12/21, 1:23 PM - V: Unlike china which had iron hands of kings like Qin shi Huang which ruled with terror and Benevolent but fierce Han Wudi
4/12/21, 1:24 PM - V: Of the Han Dynasty
4/12/21, 1:25 PM - +91 78689 12384: I'm actually surprised that such a huge move as the 1991 liberalization actually happened given the competition and lethargy
4/12/21, 1:25 PM - V: How did this discussion steer from left to right lol üòÇ

4/12/21, 1:27 PM - V: Classic Sid Meyers civilization in real life
4/12/21, 1:29 PM - +91 88794 07747: +1
4/12/21, 1:31 PM - +91 78689 12384: I mean I think it does decently okay there..IIT cs graduates that I've seen are very competent. But of course that begs the question: Does having any ranking metric and picking the top x percent mean that you'll get great people who'll do good at anything they di? I think the current PCM system values mathematical maturity + grit / determination to study something they don't like (like Chemistry) which is a reasonable metric ti produce strong engineering graduates I guess?
4/12/21, 1:32 PM - +91 78689 12384: so while this excludes very many great people who are competent at CS, what about the other side, are the people who are selected competent?
4/12/21, 1:32 PM - V: All chemistry does is to measure a person's rote learning ability
4/12/21, 1:33 PM - V: Cries in inorganic ü•≤
4/12/21, 1:33 PM - +91 78689 12384: Maybe, but it also measures that a person who was not interested in it actually had the work ethuc to make up for it
4/12/21, 1:34 PM - +91 91674 55089: Not necessarily though
4/12/21, 1:35 PM - +91 78689 12384: However, although I'm inexoerienced in Chemistry, I have heard from many Chemistry professors and students who say that although memorization is a part of it, there's a lot of elegance anf logical things that are also there
4/12/21, 1:35 PM - +91 91674 55089: It's just problem solving and logical thinking when it comes to organic
4/12/21, 1:35 PM - V: Organic is good physical is maths but that two combined is on one side
4/12/21, 1:36 PM - V: But inorganic is a separate pain
4/12/21, 1:36 PM - +91 78689 12384: I think Chemistry is unfairly denigrated tbh, just having its own terminology doesn't mean that it deserves the denigration. I mean in any field of knowledge there's a certain degree of memorization / internalisation
4/12/21, 1:36 PM - Rishabh: Don't think it does decently well/anywhere near it, relative to what MUJ, take any other college NUS, top-100 QS not even Ivys-- research o/p, startup founders, quality of Engg there. I don't see how the Tier-I here is competent.
4/12/21, 1:37 PM - V: They dont have that kind of unconventional shit in India
4/12/21, 1:37 PM - V: And then people of this country wonder why there is brain drain
4/12/21, 1:38 PM - +91 78689 12384: would respectfully disagree on quality of engineering :)
4/12/21, 1:38 PM - +91 78689 12384: Haven't investigated the rest
4/12/21, 1:40 PM - V: Don't you wonder why no iit moocs are shared in this group
4/12/21, 1:40 PM - +91 78689 12384: Top IITs CS curriculum is top notch and rigorous. I have just investigated the course materials / lectures of IIT Delhu, Bombay and Kharagpur. So may nkt apply to rest
4/12/21, 1:41 PM - Rishabh: lol
4/12/21, 1:41 PM - Rishabh: Ignorance is bliss.
4/12/21, 1:42 PM - V: Big bliss
4/12/21, 1:42 PM - +91 78689 12384: Would rather ask you to bring in evidence that indicates the opposite
4/12/21, 1:42 PM - Rishabh: For what again?
4/12/21, 1:42 PM - +91 78689 12384: That they don't perform well in terms of engineering ability
4/12/21, 1:42 PM - +91 78689 12384: Talking just CS by the way, I do not know about other branches
4/12/21, 1:43 PM - V: Lol I don't know compare a discreet math course of nptel and mit ocw
4/12/21, 1:45 PM - +91 78689 12384: Lmao look up Professor Abhijeet Das lectures..I found the lectures to be exceedingly good and they covered more in-depth material than most discrete math courses I have seen, having a very solid foundation of abstract algebra
4/12/21, 1:45 PM - Arijit: <Media omitted>
4/12/21, 1:45 PM - +91 78689 12384: Their assignments were also outstandingly rigorous
4/12/21, 1:45 PM - +91 78689 12384: I can send them here if you wush
4/12/21, 1:45 PM - +91 78689 12384: Of OS / Discrete Math / Compilers / etc
4/12/21, 1:46 PM - V: Cs 162 uc Berkeley
4/12/21, 1:46 PM - +91 78689 12384: And I think the very fact that you're comparing them to MIT is a strong indication :)
4/12/21, 1:46 PM - +91 78689 12384: I have looked at CS 70 UC Berkeley. I'm aware of the course syllabus and assignments of many university courses
4/12/21, 1:46 PM - +91 78689 12384: I can easily say that they are Berkeley level
4/12/21, 1:47 PM - +91 78689 12384: Very easily
4/12/21, 1:47 PM - +91 78689 12384: Do you want me to send assignments as proof?
4/12/21, 1:47 PM - V: I haven't seen the assignment for Abhijit das lecture
4/12/21, 1:47 PM - V: Send send
4/12/21, 1:49 PM - +91 78689 12384: <Media omitted>
4/12/21, 1:49 PM - Rishabh: Sure since you are taking wide metrics of being skilled , lets see ICPC, contribution in the field - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_science_awards
4/12/21, 1:49 PM - Rishabh: Like me to go on?
4/12/21, 1:49 PM - +91 78689 12384: <Media omitted>
4/12/21, 1:50 PM - V: Hey comparing research output is cheating üòÇ
4/12/21, 1:50 PM - Rishabh: You judge Eng. ability by assignments?
4/12/21, 1:51 PM - Rishabh: Yeah any metic we give is cheating IITs rock
4/12/21, 1:51 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yes :) I think the course project + assignments are the yardstick by which you measure the rigor of a course
4/12/21, 1:52 PM - +91 78689 12384: IIT KGP also has a SDS Lab which has produced a few popular open source software packages
4/12/21, 1:52 PM - Rishabh: Man rigor of a course != engg ability. The level of Math in JEE is Uni level for US edu.
4/12/21, 1:52 PM - Rishabh: SO all JEE qualifiers are better than any US grads
4/12/21, 1:52 PM - Rishabh: wtf?
4/12/21, 1:52 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yes, which allows them to explore subjects in greater depth..how do you define engineering ability then?
4/12/21, 1:53 PM - +91 78689 12384: https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sbansal/os/hohlabs/
4/12/21, 1:57 PM - +91 78689 12384: I'm fully in agreement with you that IITs are not at the level of CMU/MIT/etx whe  it comes to research output (although there is significant research happening, it is still not on the same scale as these institutions), their engineering courses are veey rigorous and produce graduates well versed in engineering fundamentals which is I think the important metric for engineering ability. If you di not equate rigor with   engineering ability..I don't even know
4/12/21, 1:57 PM - Rishabh: Ok take engg. ability to bebdifficulty of assignments, why is the contribution to the field by people in CS and all sub-domians so low then if they can solve so diff assignments? Ratio pioneer in CS in India? Why are people not coming to India for higher Ed if its so good, why is no one funding institutions @ the scale of other Int. Unis.
4/12/21, 1:58 PM - V: All the funding going into jio institute that's why üòâ
4/12/21, 1:58 PM - Rishabh: If they are not producing reseach o/p what does that say about their Engg. ability you think? Dong a job?
4/12/21, 1:58 PM - +91 78689 12384: https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~dmd/614_2011_homepage
4/12/21, 1:58 PM - Rishabh: OK yeah IITs are great at job factories if thats engg ability.
4/12/21, 1:59 PM - Rishabh: I never said courses curriculum is bad; teachers are thats another thing regrardless.
4/12/21, 2:00 PM - Rishabh: *most
4/12/21, 2:00 PM - +91 78689 12384: You did not, V did so I'm sending for that
4/12/21, 2:01 PM - Rishabh: Oh yeah I'm indifferent content isout there thats what this group is for; I know dropouts who are better in CS than engg grads.
4/12/21, 2:01 PM - V: Good teachers exist here but talent is underpaid and unappreciated here
4/12/21, 2:02 PM - Rishabh: btw I don't agree w/ what @919315996705 is saying; what I belive in I have  written separately not in conjunction w/ what he is writing.
4/12/21, 2:03 PM - +91 78689 12384: well I would say a lot of IIT graduates di produce good research and then enroll in PhDs in these research oriented institutions and produce great research. I think that's a solid indication that their undergrad prepares them welk fot research.
4/12/21, 2:03 PM - V: Ironically talent is preached there both by uni and companies
4/12/21, 2:04 PM - V: Thats why people migrate there
4/12/21, 2:04 PM - +91 78689 12384: I suppose the counter argument would be that attribution should be to these research institutions for allowing them to flourish..but  it is their research / thinfs they did in their undergrad that allowed them to secure that opportunity in the first place
4/12/21, 2:05 PM - +91 78689 12384: I'm in no way implying that people from othrr colleges don't do so, but from what I have seen, IITs do it much more
4/12/21, 2:05 PM - Rishabh: Yeah why don't they IITs are so good lol
4/12/21, 2:06 PM - +91 78689 12384: Do not understand the reason for sarcasm
4/12/21, 2:06 PM - +91 78689 12384: Are you saying they are just being carried over due to the reputation of IITs?
4/12/21, 2:07 PM - Rishabh: I'm, laughing @ your side of the argument no sarcasm here.
4/12/21, 2:07 PM - V: Technically the reason for them going outside of India is that iits prepare them so well lol
4/12/21, 2:08 PM - Rishabh: Ofc not let me tell you IITs hardly have any reputation nor do any UNis outside care about that.
4/12/21, 2:11 PM - V: Well they do have reputation outside
4/12/21, 2:11 PM - V: In Africa
4/12/21, 2:11 PM - +91 78689 12384: Lmao in grad admissions the quality of the undergraduate institution is also a factor, and thesr admission committees have a list of universities to consider based on their past admission statistics, they do care, frankly I think you're completely wrong about this.  They however do value their own top institutions more, so you are right in that aspect but literally IIT graduates are professors there, lots of students coming in from this institution year on year :)
4/12/21, 2:11 PM - +91 78689 12384: It is not the only factor, but it is a factor
4/12/21, 2:12 PM - +91 78689 12384: I mean I was on the other side of this debate sometime back, I then looked into it as objectively as I could and have changed my stance
4/12/21, 2:13 PM - Rishabh: Did I say anything about the admission processI said reputation,go outside in the US and say I'm from an IITs find out yourself.
4/12/21, 2:13 PM - V: Lol only condition I have seen for admission is for iits/nits minimum cgpa is 7.5 and for other unis is 8.0+
4/12/21, 2:14 PM - V: They would say wow
4/12/21, 2:15 PM - +91 78689 12384: Well I misinterpreted your argument then. The IIT name counts in engineering companies and admission commitees and not outside. If that was your stance, then all right
4/12/21, 2:15 PM - +91 78689 12384: These two entities value the rigor of your curriculum
4/12/21, 2:16 PM - V: The tag helps when person is skilled enough to justify it
4/12/21, 2:16 PM - +91 78689 12384: Really? And where have you seen this condition?
4/12/21, 2:16 PM - V: Uk admission criteria
4/12/21, 2:16 PM - V: I can send it here if you want
4/12/21, 2:17 PM - +91 78689 12384: Sure send it
4/12/21, 2:17 PM - +91 78689 12384: That's the point..the rigor prepares people to justify it.
4/12/21, 2:18 PM - V: https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/apply/requirements/pgacademic/
4/12/21, 2:19 PM - V: @917868912384
4/12/21, 2:20 PM - +91 78689 12384: This is the bare minimum that makes you eligible for admission, if you meet this criteria, it does not mean that you'll get admission. I mean this really strengthens my arfument: If they took the time to create a separate elite institution list, do you really not think they'll give priority to applicants from those universities unless the applicants from other universities have something extraordinary in their profile
4/12/21, 2:21 PM - V: I did mention the word minimum
4/12/21, 2:21 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yes, I perhaps wrongly interpreted your intention as to provide a counterpoint to my stance
4/12/21, 2:22 PM - +91 78689 12384: There are similar, however unsaid guidelines in US universities
4/12/21, 2:22 PM - V: Also doesn't  reducing the minimum GPA requirements for elite institutions even the odds for everyone
4/12/21, 2:24 PM - +91 78689 12384: Not really lmao a 10 GPA from MUJ (unless they did something to really stand out) would not hold a candle to a 8GPA there purely because they have simply not been exposed to that kind of rigor. Are you telling me that in an OS course where you do numericals you score full marks and this guy gets a B for making a OS kernel and this sort of evens the odds?
4/12/21, 2:24 PM - +91 78689 12384: Preposterous
4/12/21, 2:24 PM - V: What lies beyond is what that person did past 4 years
4/12/21, 2:25 PM - V: Marks are marks and doing projects is personal goodwill here
4/12/21, 2:25 PM - +91 78689 12384: Agreed, ultimately it is this that counts but an institute's rigor and environment goes a long way into enabling the person to do so. People outside this environment also do so, but it is a testament to the university that their graduates are able to do so
4/12/21, 2:25 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yes, but if projects are mandated as part of the curriculum, that simply means that for an outsider, there's a much higher probability for them to look into an IIT
4/12/21, 2:26 PM - +91 78689 12384: Your mettle is ultimately what counts
4/12/21, 2:26 PM - V: All we can do is close the gap by doing things
4/12/21, 2:27 PM - +91 78689 12384: But the core debate was whether IIT was good or not and I think we have established that they have a rigorous curriculum and solid graduates
4/12/21, 2:28 PM - V: Iits maybe good but after doing pg it doesn't matter where your ug was from
4/12/21, 2:29 PM - Rishabh: You have in your mind thats cool, theres no need to genralize, I wish everyone well IITs otherwise, everyone get what they are worth.
4/12/21, 2:30 PM - V: Whether we did it at an iit or vit doing a master's degree in mechanical engineering from tum would make them equally good
4/12/21, 2:31 PM - V: The vit guy maybe would have to work more or study more or gain more practical experience
4/12/21, 2:31 PM - V: To compensate
4/12/21, 2:33 PM - +91 78689 12384: well obviously I never meant to say that an IIT graduate would forever be superior, of course a university is a platform and it is up to you how much valye you can extract from your education. The premise of being a good institution is just that it provides a good platform and an enabling environment. An elite institution would just make it "easy" to do greater thinfs. If the VIT guy makes it to TUM, or some other elite institution I would argue that this is a testament to this person's incredible drive and determination.
4/12/21, 2:34 PM - +91 78689 12384: Same applies to all institutions of course, MIT/CMU/etc. I just brought up that point because we were talking about relative difference in "eliteness"
4/12/21, 2:35 PM - +91 78689 12384: Nevertheless, I suppose the debate has wandered off into a useless track now so I'll stop since many of our fundamental notions are different so we'll never agree

4/13/21, 12:33 PM - Rishabh: I've read it afaik the results are nit exponentially better..
4/13/21, 12:35 PM - +91 95896 97149: It is a step in the right direction though, these techniques are new, I mean most of the papers that I have been able to find on this topic have been after the dawn of the millennium. There is a lot of work that needs to be done in this field. It is a like a baby as compared to the other mammoth giants out there.
4/13/21, 12:39 PM - Rishabh: Its new coz adversarial training is; the idea is very intriguing however I(along w/ all of the researcher's papers I've read don't seem to think they can be used in an applied setting) not in its current state, last I checked the best the complex networks came up w/ was XOR.

4/14/21, 4:36 PM - +91 78689 12384: Seems like this is as good a place as any: does anyone understand how the sum of all natural numbers is associated with -1/12
4/14/21, 4:37 PM - +91 78689 12384: I have tried reading Terence Tao's article linking it to complex analysis and domain extension but I couldn't follow aling, it was a bit too involved fot me
4/14/21, 4:44 PM - V: Ramanujan summation ?
4/14/21, 4:45 PM - +91 78689 12384: yeah and I'm not talking about the infinite series manipulation that is now considered incorrect by mathematicians since you cannot add or subtract infinite series
4/14/21, 4:46 PM - V: Lol the infinite ap sum is considered wrong ?
4/14/21, 4:46 PM - +91 78689 12384: The result is still the same, but the appriach to it is wrong
4/14/21, 4:47 PM - +91 78689 12384: The infinite gp sum is correct, it is a converging sequence
4/14/21, 4:47 PM - +91 78689 12384: I'm not talking about that
4/14/21, 4:47 PM - +91 78689 12384: I'm talking about for a divergent sequence
4/14/21, 4:47 PM - +91 78689 12384: Like 1+2+3+...
4/14/21, 4:47 PM - +91 78689 12384: Not 1+1/2+1/4
4/14/21, 4:47 PM - V: Makes sense tho since anything in mathematics is assumed to be quantified we theorize among those lines only
4/14/21, 4:48 PM - +91 78689 12384: For this, the explanation given as a cliff's notes approach is to manipulate infinite series like A + B but that is incorrect
4/14/21, 4:48 PM - +91 78689 12384: Although it yields the same result
4/14/21, 4:48 PM - +91 78689 12384: It is also considered incorrect to say that 1+2+3... Equals -1/12
4/14/21, 4:48 PM - +91 78689 12384: Better to say associated
4/14/21, 4:48 PM - V: But in a case of a number which we don't have idea of this theory fails we assume infinity to be a very large number

4/14/21, 4:56 PM - +91 78689 12384: What's the basis for analytical continuation
4/14/21, 4:58 PM - V: I think they tested hypothesis to a few extent to see the pattern emerging commonly and then assumed that it's true entirely
4/14/21, 4:59 PM - V: And probably said that we dont give a fuck if it fails
4/14/21, 4:59 PM - +91 78689 12384: I would agree for other fields like Physics..but for math without a rigorous proof, nothing is accepted
4/14/21, 4:59 PM - V: Its biggest proof is that theory held up in experimental physics
4/14/21, 5:00 PM - V: Like you said
4/14/21, 5:01 PM - +91 78689 12384: Agreed, a physicist accepts it butt a mathematician won't.. that's why the riemann hypothesis is stilk considered unproven even though it holds for all rhe numbers we have tested (till massively large limits(
4/14/21, 5:02 PM - +91 78689 12384: there was some theorem which held for all numbers under 10467 or something like that, this is the sort of stuff due to which mathematicians prefer proofs

4/14/21, 5:05 PM - +91 78689 12384: Mathematicians don't find rigorous proofs just to prove something is true, it is to better our understanding of maths. Fermat's last theorem was unproven for 300 years till the mathematical advances in ideas were sufficient to support such an enterprise
4/14/21, 5:05 PM - +91 78689 12384: Its proof yielded many connections between disparate areas of mathematics that drived innovation in those areas, moving them forward
4/14/21, 5:05 PM - V: Yup somethings just become facts with time
4/14/21, 5:06 PM - V: You can't believe them but you can't think without them
4/14/21, 5:06 PM - V: So as humans we take the easy way out
4/14/21, 5:06 PM - V: Assume and get on with life
4/14/21, 6:06 PM - Astitva: If all you're interested in is an explanation to a layman of why a thing like analytic continuation makes any sense to begin with (in particular, why it spits out a unique answer), the answer is the identity theorem for holomorphic functions, which in its stronger form says that if two holomorphic functions  defined on a connected open subset  of  are equal on a set of points in  with an accumulation point (in particular any open subset of ), then in fact . This is an extremely strong rigidity theorem generalizing the corresponding fact for polynomials, and shows that if you want to extend a holomorphic function  defined on some domain  to a function  defined on some larger connected domain , then there is at most one way to do it (since any two extensions agree on  and hence agree on ).

One sense of "analytic continuation" is that it refers to any function  with the above property, and another sense of "analytic continuation" is that it refers to methods for defining  given .

Sometimes it is the case that a function  can be analytically continued to a very large domain  but that a series or integral defining  can't be made to converge on all of . The philosophical point to take away from this is that holomorphic functions have a sort of "Platonic reality" that isn't necessarily perfectly captured by any particular series or integral definition of them, which are just imperfect "shadows" of this Platonic reality. The slogan I use in this situation and others like it is that

convergence is overrated.
4/14/21, 6:07 PM - Astitva: Reason for why analytic continuation works
4/14/21, 6:07 PM - Astitva: If you want to go through the derivation of the functional equation:

4/14/21, 7:51 PM - V: Cool
4/14/21, 7:51 PM - +91 78689 12384: Thanks a lot, this went over mt head a bit, given that I lack a lot of pieces, so I'll keep rereading this till I understand more
4/14/21, 8:00 PM - Astitva: It's really simple apart from the proof that requires deeper background in complex analysis. The basic idea is the theorem that holomorphic functions are analytic so for any given holomorphic function, we can have a corresponding analytic series expansion. This gives us a way to derive the general form of the function corresponding to the definition of the Riemann Series defined for re(z) > 1. And we use the functional equation derived to compute the values for the mirror of the domain of the series.
4/14/21, 8:01 PM - Astitva: It don't quite understand the derivation as I studied CA 4 years ago so am rusty with things. Would have to revise it to give a better explanation
4/14/21, 8:02 PM - +91 78689 12384: Oh I'm curious..how did you come across complex analysis that early?

4/14/21, 8:04 PM - Astitva: I was looking into various higher level mathematics subfields so just bought a book and studied it and referenced the internet when I got stuck to get a hold of things
4/14/21, 8:05 PM - Astitva: I went through the book by Lars Ahlfors on CA, was really nice not that high paced really explained things starting from the basics so really enjoyed working through it..

4/15/21, 1:48 PM - Astitva: I feel you man
4/15/21, 1:48 PM - +91 78689 12384: there should be better tab management tools for phones
4/15/21, 1:48 PM - +91 83558 14130: Use OneTab
4/15/21, 1:48 PM - +91 78689 12384: There are bunch of crap sites open that I want to close by domain
4/15/21, 1:48 PM - +91 83558 14130: +1 I have 200 tabs
4/15/21, 1:48 PM - +91 83558 14130: on Chrome Mobile
4/15/21, 1:48 PM - Rishabh: Upgrade to mac don't ever close tabs again.
4/15/21, 1:48 PM - Astitva: browsers should provide built in tree structures for tabs

4/15/21, 1:50 PM - +91 83558 14130: But pretty impressed my OnePlus 6 can handle this
4/15/21, 1:50 PM - +91 78689 12384: <Media omitted>
4/15/21, 1:50 PM - +91 78689 12384: If my redmi note 5 pro can handle 1000 tabs I'm sure OnePlus 6 can
4/15/21, 1:50 PM - +91 83558 14130: Yes
4/15/21, 1:50 PM - +91 78689 12384: Probably more than 1000 but don't know since it doesn't show number of tabs
4/15/21, 1:51 PM - +91 78689 12384: Once it is past 100
4/15/21, 1:51 PM - +91 83558 14130: Yeaaa
4/15/21, 1:51 PM - +91 83558 14130: Thx to google engineers
4/15/21, 1:51 PM - +91 78689 12384: I only know around 1000 sinxe by mistake closed all and it showed number of tabs closed

4/15/21, 2:06 PM - +91 87088 21604: Ramanujan Syndrome?

I first seen this mess in string theory of michiu kaku

Uhh
4/15/21, 2:06 PM - +91 87088 21604: https://kutt.it/HILNEN
4/15/21, 2:08 PM - +91 78689 12384: Hmmm yes in some Physics theories it is valid. So as far as I remember from Terence Tao's derivation, he said that the sum represents -1/12 + an error term that is infinitely large. He then explores its connection to analytic continuation, particularly why the error term disappeared
4/15/21, 2:08 PM - +91 78689 12384: I could not understand the connection at the time I gad read it
4/15/21, 2:09 PM - V: Lol how much ram
4/15/21, 2:10 PM - +91 87088 21604: üòÇüòÇlol
4/15/21, 2:12 PM - +91 78689 12384: Firefox takes up 1.5 GB RAM only
4/15/21, 2:12 PM - +91 78689 12384: It is that giod
4/15/21, 2:12 PM - +91 78689 12384: I have 12GB tho
4/15/21, 2:20 PM - Rishabh: https://www.nuschool.so
4/15/21, 2:20 PM - Rishabh: tabs?
4/15/21, 2:21 PM - +91 78689 12384: what?
4/15/21, 2:21 PM - +91 78689 12384: If you're asking about the number: around 7000 tabs and 15-18 windows
4/15/21, 2:23 PM - Rishabh: Taking 1.5G RAM?
4/15/21, 2:23 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yes
4/15/21, 2:24 PM - +91 78689 12384: My bad
4/15/21, 2:24 PM - +91 78689 12384: 2.1 gb
4/15/21, 2:24 PM - +91 78689 12384: If you scale up the number of windows, yeah it shoots up
4/15/21, 2:24 PM - +91 78689 12384: At 25 windows it takes a lot of RAM
4/15/21, 2:25 PM - +91 78689 12384: Not dependent on number of tabs for the most part
4/15/21, 2:25 PM - +91 78689 12384: Of course, not all the tabs are in memory.. when you click then it loads, else this wouldn't be possible
4/15/21, 2:27 PM - +91 78689 12384: That's how Chrome does it too I think but for some reason it doesn't scale well
4/15/21, 2:27 PM - +91 78689 12384: At least when I lasr used Chrome
4/15/21, 2:30 PM - +91 87088 21604: Because blink is so bloat

For me compilation of chromium took 16 hrs
On other hand for Firefox it took me 7 hrs
4/15/21, 2:31 PM - +91 78689 12384: Damn do you compile all your packages?
4/15/21, 2:31 PM - +91 78689 12384: Are you on Gentoo or something?
4/15/21, 2:31 PM - +91 78689 12384: Next up on the meta resources interview train xD
4/15/21, 2:31 PM - +91 78689 12384: Which distros have you used
4/15/21, 2:32 PM - +91 87088 21604: Other packages are libatomic some libpulseaudio they don't even take 5 minutes or so
4/15/21, 2:32 PM - +91 87088 21604: No no I'm on void rn
4/15/21, 2:32 PM - +91 87088 21604: Not many Ubuntu artix fedora debian void
4/15/21, 2:32 PM - +91 78689 12384: yeah I tried to compile Firefox once, noped out of there
4/15/21, 2:32 PM - +91 78689 12384: So fast
4/15/21, 2:33 PM - +91 78689 12384: what's the fancy stuff that artix and void offer
4/15/21, 2:33 PM - +91 78689 12384: *slow
4/15/21, 2:33 PM - +91 78689 12384: Seems my brain is crapping out
4/15/21, 2:34 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yes actually I'm testing xbps-src template for ug-chromium so i have to..
But we're not near to compile perfectly ug chromium
4/15/21, 2:34 PM - +91 87088 21604: Umm no systemd 
I use void for xbps and minimalism
4/15/21, 2:35 PM - +91 87088 21604: Something not work in non-systemd distros like snap XD
4/15/21, 2:35 PM - +91 78689 12384: Nice, it feels very cool to me from its website but I cannot pinpoint wgy
4/15/21, 2:35 PM - +91 87088 21604: wgy??
4/15/21, 2:35 PM - +91 78689 12384: is the main argument against systemd that it does too many things?
4/15/21, 2:35 PM - +91 78689 12384: Why
4/15/21, 2:37 PM - ACM Chotu joined using this group's invite link
4/15/21, 2:37 PM - +91 87088 21604: For me i don't hate systemd but i love runit.
For me my lappy boots in 7 sec whereas in s6 it took just 4sec (mind it** it's hdd) whereas in systemd due to some control jobs running it took almost a minute
4/15/21, 2:37 PM - +91 87088 21604: But s6 is complicated for me a bit
4/15/21, 2:38 PM - +91 87088 21604: Runit is very smooth simple
4/15/21, 2:39 PM - +91 87088 21604: You know runits last update was in 2015.

The dev said this project is fully complete and needs no further development (not to be feature creep)

4/15/21, 9:27 PM - +91 78689 12384: For knowing how coroutines work, I found this stack exchange answer quite useful
4/15/21, 9:28 PM - +91 78689 12384: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49005651/how-does-asyncio-actually-work
4/15/21, 9:28 PM - V: What does asyncio do ?
4/15/21, 9:29 PM - V: I have to go on my learning hitlist after vue
4/15/21, 9:29 PM - +91 78689 12384: Haven't used it personally, but seems like the usual async thing: whenever you make ant I/O requests, it runs some other tasks instead of wasting time and when the I/O request you're waiting on is completed,the  only it runs your task
4/15/21, 9:29 PM - V: Some very good resources popping around here and there
4/15/21, 9:29 PM - V: Add Go
4/15/21, 9:30 PM - +91 78689 12384: So for I/O bound applications, you can get great performance even with just one thread
4/15/21, 9:30 PM - +91 87088 21604: Add sevlete too
4/15/21, 9:32 PM - V: Ok what if all our tasks request I/O
4/15/21, 9:33 PM - V: I was thinking to take a look at reason Ml
4/15/21, 9:33 PM - +91 87088 21604: Not industry standard
4/15/21, 9:33 PM - V: I am not planning on going in industry
4/15/21, 9:34 PM - V: Oni2 I am liking very much
4/15/21, 9:34 PM - +91 87088 21604: Ohh that's good
4/15/21, 9:34 PM - +91 87088 21604: Nice
4/15/21, 9:34 PM - +91 78689 12384: then ig your program doesn't get scheduled till some I/O tasks complete, it is just a pattern to make better use  of threads. Usually in most cases there's always something waiting to take uo cpu tine
4/15/21, 9:34 PM - +91 87088 21604: Only core parts do
4/15/21, 9:34 PM - +91 78689 12384: Research m
4/15/21, 9:34 PM - +91 78689 12384: *?
4/15/21, 9:35 PM - +91 87088 21604: An asynchronous method call is a method used in programming that returns to the caller immediately before the completion of its processing and without blocking the calling thread.
4/15/21, 9:35 PM - V: I will see as I do things currently I want to see everything
4/15/21, 9:35 PM - +91 78689 12384: Cool
4/15/21, 9:36 PM - V: Hey thats just like round robin scheduling
4/15/21, 9:37 PM - +91 78689 12384: How so,m,
4/15/21, 9:37 PM - +91 78689 12384: *?
4/15/21, 9:37 PM - +91 87088 21604: Wdym?
4/15/21, 9:37 PM - +91 78689 12384: yikes my keyboard
4/15/21, 9:38 PM - +91 78689 12384: you're sort of right though, non preemptivve, since once your i/o task is started you pick the next one and make progress
4/15/21, 9:38 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yeah I can see it
4/15/21, 9:38 PM - V: The process doesn't completely get completed  if the quantum is small
4/15/21, 9:39 PM - V: So it assigns it to a.priority queue .
4/15/21, 9:39 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yeah but here there is no quantum, that is preemptive scheduling. You're basically running a task as long as you can till you have to wair any way at which point you make progress on the next task
4/15/21, 9:40 PM - +91 78689 12384: there is no timeslice as such in play here
4/15/21, 9:40 PM - +91 78689 12384: there, the flow is timer interrupt -> schedule next
Here it is -> cooperatively give up control when you know you're going to wait for some I/O
4/15/21, 9:41 PM - +91 78689 12384: Waiting has no business on a CPU
4/15/21, 9:41 PM - +91 78689 12384: Need to utilize as much as possible

4/17/21, 4:42 PM - +91 78939 07417: it is not something I have come up with. This is used in "CubeSLAM: Monocular 3-D Object SLAM" paper and apparently mentioned in Zisserman's book on CV. I just tried to reason out why this happens for my understanding and thought that someone in this group might also be interested.

4/19/21, 11:30 PM - V: Nothing comes close
4/19/21, 11:30 PM - Rishabh: True.
4/19/21, 11:30 PM - Rishabh: Except Razer maybe.
4/19/21, 11:31 PM - V: Lol 2,15000 mei why dont buy a high end macbook pro
4/19/21, 11:31 PM - V: Razer is uselessly expensive windows machine
4/19/21, 11:32 PM - Rishabh: RZR has touch 4k OLED GPU THX DOLBY
4/19/21, 11:32 PM - V: In a 15 inch screen it doesn't matter
4/19/21, 11:32 PM - V: Eats battery life
4/19/21, 11:32 PM - V: Thx Dolby is good to have
4/19/21, 11:32 PM - Rishabh: Has good battery as well.
4/19/21, 11:32 PM - Rishabh: Vapor cooling.
4/19/21, 11:33 PM - Rishabh: Especially vision
4/19/21, 11:33 PM - +91 78689 12384: RAM expandable?
4/19/21, 11:33 PM - V: Agreed but aren't razers too pricy for the things
4/19/21, 11:33 PM - Rishabh: No ultrabooks that form factor are soldered completely.
4/19/21, 11:33 PM - V: I mean macbook have better trackpad and speakers
4/19/21, 11:34 PM - +91 78689 12384: Who said
4/19/21, 11:34 PM - Rishabh: Actually fairly prices 30 series GPU cmon 11gen
4/19/21, 11:34 PM - Rishabh: Not speakers.
4/19/21, 11:34 PM - Rishabh: Trackpad on RZR is comparable.
4/19/21, 11:34 PM - +91 78689 12384: Never seen a quad HD and a 4k side by side, but that is a bold statement to make
4/19/21, 11:34 PM - V: Lol I have a 4k 15 inch screen laptop other than this
4/19/21, 11:35 PM - +91 78689 12384: All right, then may be so, I've never used one
4/19/21, 11:35 PM - V: High refresh rate laptops are more useful
4/19/21, 11:35 PM - +91 6200 548 891: Why we configure a lappy with same mac amount with Linux OS as it may faster and high specs??
4/19/21, 11:35 PM - +91 6200 548 891: Why
4/19/21, 11:35 PM - Rishabh: Yeah high refresh + high res is expensive though,
4/19/21, 11:36 PM - Rishabh: Not really if you are not gaming
4/19/21, 11:37 PM - V: look you asked for M1 Macbook pro and air the price to performance mac provide is not easily beatable by other equivalent windows machine
4/19/21, 11:37 PM - V: So if you asked for macbook M1 I assume you don't want gaming laptop
4/19/21, 11:38 PM - Rishabh: Nvidia also entering the CPU business
4/19/21, 11:38 PM - Rishabh: Intel is fucked pretty bad.
4/19/21, 11:38 PM - V: How much intel is going to loose
4/19/21, 11:38 PM - V: Lol Microsoft support on x86 is good and arm is bad
4/19/21, 11:39 PM - V: Like super bad bad
4/19/21, 11:39 PM - Rishabh: Yeah their AMD builds are very poor.
4/19/21, 11:40 PM - +91 6200 548 891: Bhai maine bss pucha maine kbhi nhi khareeda hai mac ya windows bss ghar pe pda hai usi me chalata hu
4/19/21, 11:40 PM - +91 6200 548 891: Gaming nahi Krna bro
4/19/21, 11:40 PM - V: Until unless intel adopts arm as their core architecture or Microsoft has to optimise windows for arm properly x86 will dominate in windows
4/19/21, 11:42 PM - Rishabh: Intel still stuck @ 7nm
4/19/21, 11:42 PM - Rishabh: Apple/AMD/NV all @ 5nm someat 3nm pre-prod
4/19/21, 11:43 PM - Rishabh: TMC is working on prod of 3nm I believe
4/19/21, 11:44 PM - V: Proprietary support matters ultimately 3nm keench le voh baadme dekhenge log pehle dhang se chalta kispe voh dekhenge aur considering Microsoft voh bohot jaldi change nahi hoga
4/19/21, 11:44 PM - Rishabh: ARM anyone can license.
4/19/21, 11:44 PM - Rishabh: *
4/19/21, 11:44 PM - V: Windows for arm only 32 bit x86 application
4/19/21, 11:45 PM - +91 78689 12384: I had read that Intel's 7nm and the 5nm by TSMC are equivalent.. they're measuring different things. Will try ti dig up the source
4/19/21, 11:45 PM - V: Haan I know but every company isn't into chip manufacturing and doesn't have enough infra and Manpower to pull an M1
4/19/21, 11:46 PM - Rishabh: True,.
4/19/21, 11:47 PM - Rishabh: Think thats correct but the cost difference is huge.
4/19/21, 11:47 PM - +91 78689 12384: yeah chip fabrication is super expensive, at the very high end there are just 57 lithography machine in the world and are all owned by this danish company
4/19/21, 11:47 PM - +91 78689 12384: *57 lithography machines
4/19/21, 11:48 PM - +91 78689 12384: *manufactured

4/20/21, 10:41 PM - +91 78689 12384: this is epic, I know Meltdown is old, but today was the day I actually sat down and read (well still reading) its paper:
https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf
my summary: https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf

Key idea: Processors do Out of order execution where they predict which line of instructions is most likely, load them in and execute them in parallel. Key point is that at this point the CPU's memory protection features aren't active. Before commiting the processor's state, the CPU checks if any exceptions were raised and at that point discards the results if an illegal access was made. It also resets the registers.

However, it does not reset the cache (presumably because it is expensive), so unexecuted instructions had side effects.

There is a cache attack known as flush and reload, where the program ensures that none of the contents of a special array is cached. The array is 256 * 4096 bytes.

A monitoring process can access elements of this array and measure the time it takes for access. If any page (one 4096 byte element) takes less time, it means that it was cached.

This is where the trick comes in:
The process tricks the branch prediction into predicting that a certain sequence of instructions will be executed. This instruction sequence fetches the byte from an address and then accesses the 256 * 4096 byte array based on this index. Due to OOO, this sequence of instructions is executed then the results are flushed, but the page that the instruction accessed is still cached, so the monitoring process (using the time attack described above) can figure out what the byte was (8 bits  = 256 values, so the page which has low access time, its index is the byte)

This can be used to dump the entire phyical memory, thus the program accesses addreses that it shouldn't be able to.
4/20/21, 10:48 PM - +91 78689 12384: though this does raise the question: it probably does discard memory writes too, then why can't it discard cache writes
4/20/21, 11:30 PM - +91 78689 12384: I was told this is because the memory controller is separate and can be called asynchronously while the cpu cachee controller blocks up the CPU
4/20/21, 11:30 PM - +91 78689 12384: And that a redesign of  the  CPU to have an independent cache controller was considered but apparently it was considered too complex / infeasible

4/21/21, 4:33 PM - +91 87088 21604: I don't think so packages are outdated as much as Debian they are comparatively new may be not uptodated with upstream but it's all to maintain stability of OS.

either by forming a peer connection or what

4/27/21, 3:04 AM - Rishabh: Dear friends!

Thank you for registering for our Open-Source Arts Lecture Series! This email contains important links to the private Zoom rooms (and public YouTube streams) where you can catch these talks. 

This semester, with support from the NEA and the Clinic for Open-Source Arts, we've hosted a group of creative technologists who are developing Open-Source Software Toolkits for the Arts (#OSSTA). Each evening from Monday through Thursday this week, from 5-7pm EDT, our guests will deliver a series of free evening presentations about the tools they‚Äôve been working to realize‚Äîand the creative practices that have motivated them to create these new tools.

Below are the schedules and links you'll need. Note:

Visit here for complete biographies and more information about our speakers.
We ask you please not to share the private Zoom links, which are exclusively for people who have registered in advance, like yourself.
If you'd prefer, you may also catch the talks live-streamed on YouTube (feel free to share the YouTube links publicly on social media). The talks will also be permanently archived on both YouTube and Vimeo. 
Our Zoom rooms are moderated. Please note that all participants will be expected to comply with the Code of Conduct below.
All presentations will be close-captioned.

4/28/21, 6:03 PM - +91 88794 07747: Just in case I miss bookmarking a couple of links
4/28/21, 6:09 PM - Rishabh: Not automated currently @917903238656 tries his best to update
4/28/21, 6:09 PM - Rishabh: But largely links from whatsapp are disconnected from Airtable since there is no automation in place the only way to update is the form.
4/28/21, 6:11 PM - Rishabh: Airtable currently has 913 annotated and 2k total but the actual number is close to 4K
4/28/21, 6:13 PM - +91 88794 07747: Oh, ohk... Cause I couldn't find timestamps on the links on Airtable as well, was confused on the timeline
4/28/21, 6:16 PM - Rishabh: Yeahh  in the admit chat we were discussing ways of automating this.
4/28/21, 6:16 PM - Rishabh: Let me know if you‚Äôd be interested in working on something like that...
4/28/21, 6:17 PM - +91 88794 07747: So, is there an API for airtable, have never worked with it before
4/28/21, 6:17 PM - Rishabh: This is what we came up with
4/28/21, 6:17 PM - Rishabh: Chat Export --> RegEX --> Hyperlinks --> Extract Meta-Data --> Push to Airtable ---> Hyperlinks | links | Description |Meta-data

4/28/21, 7:42 PM - V: The Annotated Transformer

3 years ago Alexander Rush created an incredible notebook supported the "Attention is All You Need" paper giving a possibility to dive in the implementation details and obtain your own transformer :)

We, SkoltechNLP group, within our Neual NLP 2021 course revisited this notebook for adapting it as a seminar. Of course, the original code was created 3 years ago and in some places is incompatible with new versions of required libraries. As a result, we created "runnable with 'Run all Cells' for April 2021" version of this notebook:
https://github.com/skoltech-nlp/annotated-transformer

So if you want to learn the Transformer and run an example in your computer or Colab, you can save your time and use current version of this great notebook. Also, we add some links to the amazing resources about Transformers that emerged during these years:
* Seq2Seq and Attention by Lena Voita;
* The Illustrated Transformer.

5/14/21, 12:42 PM - Astitva: sure
5/14/21, 12:42 PM - Rishabh: Cool lemme know then we can update the table.
5/14/21, 12:47 PM - Astitva: there's some redundancy as well as a lot of "not-suitable-for-db" links but I'll let you be the judge of that...besides that it's all there
5/14/21, 12:47 PM - Rishabh: Yeah all of it is extracted so some other bs links included as well
5/14/21, 12:48 PM - Astitva: also a lot of these are probably already in the main db so maybe create another extracted-table for them
5/14/21, 12:48 PM - Rishabh: Redundency could be due to tagging of the links in the chat.
5/14/21, 12:48 PM - Astitva: it'll store all the links that go here
5/14/21, 12:48 PM - Rishabh: Cool can you import the csv into a new sheet in the same base?
5/14/21, 12:48 PM - Rishabh: Then we can curate.
5/14/21, 12:48 PM - Rishabh: Cool
5/14/21, 12:49 PM - Astitva: nah it's usually due to slashes or stuff like that

5/19/21, 10:39 PM - +91 98185 62450: yar ykw it is pretty predictable
5/19/21, 10:39 PM - +91 98185 62450: public opinion is a major driver

5/19/21, 10:44 PM - +91 87088 21604: And that crypto market is all about world's richest memer these daysüòÇüòÇ
5/19/21, 10:46 PM - Rishabh: Crypto is no different than stocks but with true rather than adjusted volatility as its decentralised(relative to stocks)
5/19/21, 10:52 PM - Astitva: stocks majorly work on market sentiments anyway so in that sense they aren't very different at all
5/19/21, 10:53 PM - Rishabh: Exactly, I‚Äôll say stocks are rather unpredictable than crypto.
5/19/21, 10:53 PM - +91 87088 21604: Umm I really like to go in depth of it.
I don't know much about crypto.
But I know a companies stocks can get affected due to various situations like in this pandemic oxygen companies are in more demand so it's very natural that company will grow and it's stocks price will increase for sure.
Same like with Microsoft in governance (CEO) of Satya Nadella, MS introduced so many things that lead to rise of MS. Same with Sundar Pichai as he leaded chrome segment and in return both GOOGL and ALPHABET got raised.
I don't know about such factors applicable to crypto market, which I haven't studied well
5/19/21, 10:55 PM - Rishabh: It‚Äôs an interesting discussion..we can have a voice channel chat if some people are interested?
5/19/21, 10:55 PM - Rishabh: Inefficient to type here
5/19/21, 10:55 PM - Astitva: they are different "types" of tradable securities so obviously gonna have different extents to which the public sentiment effects them but at the heart of it, any publicly traded entity has the same mechanics
5/19/21, 10:55 PM - Astitva: NEED A DISCORD META_RESOURCES.
5/19/21, 10:57 PM - +91 87088 21604: I do think so but don't know much about crypto (as I've not much interest in it)
5/19/21, 10:57 PM - +91 87088 21604: I would like to be part of it.

5/21/21, 8:07 PM - +91 88794 07747: Hey, can someone help me out. I am wondering how to process users who register onto a website, but none of the information they'll see will be privileged. If on the signup form you ask for their email and then verify the email through a verification link, and only allow your db to use unique emails, many different issues might pop up, even without taking malicious intent into account. A user might mistype their email, and then a person with the mistyped email, won't be able to create an account with that email. The solution I came up with was to allow multiple users to register with the same email, but once one of the users verifies that email, I'd ask each one of them to register again. Is this a valid approach?
5/21/21, 8:07 PM - +91 88794 07747: I couldn't find any resources related to this particular need
5/21/21, 8:09 PM - +91 78689 12384: I don't understand the problem with the mistyped email. Could you expand? Ot doesn't fill any space in DB since ot would be unverified and the user csn just type in the correct email?,
5/21/21, 8:12 PM - +91 88794 07747: I was just giving an example where a user might give an email that can't be verified by that particular user due to  any number of reasons. That was just an example
5/21/21, 8:14 PM - +91 78689 12384: If they give a mistyped email, then can't they try again with the correct email? Is there some other issue I'm not seeing?
5/21/21, 8:15 PM - +91 88794 07747: If I was a person with malicious intent I could just write a script which registers  a lot of random emails on to my website creating new users, but the genuine users won't be able to create an account on the website with that email
5/21/21, 8:16 PM - +91 88794 07747: Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
5/21/21, 8:16 PM - +91 86691 45213: Using email as a unique key for accounts is bad practice, but regardless:

You can create a user flow that does not create a permanent account on sign up instantly. Type email -> Link sent to email -> User opens and fills in other information like Name, and password.
The link needs to be unique and expirable so you'll have to maintain a record of active links.

Or you can have auth logic to prevent data access to unverified accounts. And delete unverified accounts after a certain time.
5/21/21, 8:16 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yes, but your unique pool should only be from verified emails
5/21/21, 8:16 PM - +91 78689 12384: Till an email has not been verified, it has not been claimed
5/21/21, 8:17 PM - +91 78689 12384: I guess that's what you were saying
5/21/21, 8:17 PM - +91 78689 12384: When you said "allow multiple users"
5/21/21, 8:17 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yes
5/21/21, 8:17 PM - +91 78689 12384: Looks valid

But I think it'll loose its position as Rust and Zig gets mature and popular.

5/23/21, 1:05 PM - +91 78689 12384: What do you mean? I don't think there's any constraint on the language in which you write your language compiler
5/23/21, 1:06 PM - +91 78689 12384: I'm not even aware of major languages transpiling to C

5/23/21, 1:30 PM - +91 87088 21604: I mean if you want to write your own language, you can write first version either in C or ASM as they're reliable and mature (I'm aware that one can write in rust too, but it's not stable yet).

And no doubt one can write language in Python, Lisp, etc.

But C is obvious choice for anyone who considering writing a language.

Like GO compiler firstly written in C then in GO itself
Same with Rust
5/23/21, 1:33 PM - +91 87088 21604: https://vlang.io/


This lang also can compile to C
5/23/21, 1:34 PM - +91 78689 12384: Usually the first version of the language is written in C/C++ then the language is bootstrapped using the same language
5/23/21, 1:34 PM - +91 78689 12384: Haskell compiler written in Haskell
5/23/21, 1:34 PM - +91 78689 12384: Rust compiler written in Rust
5/23/21, 1:34 PM - +91 78689 12384: Go compiler written in To

5/23/21, 1:39 PM - Astitva: I don't think there's a universally proven set of necessary and sufficient conditions for making a "safe" lang. The term itself can mean different things depending on use cases.

5/30/21, 3:31 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Even file deletion in windows is so slow lol
5/30/21, 3:32 PM - Mehul Srivastava: I had 2 folders of 10 gigs, and had to delete them, took like 2 mins when doing from windows

Went to linux, mounted the drive and deleted that way, took 10 seconds
5/30/21, 3:33 PM - +91 83558 14130: yea windows trash bruh
5/30/21, 3:33 PM - +91 87088 21604: File system NTFS üåù
5/30/21, 3:33 PM - Rishabh: Not true you can use command line tools to do the same thing most linux distorts do
5/30/21, 3:33 PM - Mehul Srivastava: To make the deletion slow?
5/30/21, 3:33 PM - Rishabh: Faster or same speed
5/30/21, 3:33 PM - +91 83558 14130: could use wsl? if you were on windows tbh
5/30/21, 3:34 PM - Rishabh: R/W depends on the file system type not OS
5/30/21, 3:34 PM - Mehul Srivastava: :))
5/30/21, 3:34 PM - Rishabh: Faster than FAT32 which is typically what Linux uses
5/30/21, 3:35 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Still doesn't explain what happened here na lol
5/30/21, 3:37 PM - +91 78689 12384: Ext4 is the most common in Linux
5/30/21, 3:39 PM - +91 78689 12384: idk gui deletion has been ifft on linux too for me, rm has always been faster
5/30/21, 3:39 PM - Rishabh: Ex FAT as well

5/30/21, 4:04 PM - +91 83558 14130: man srsly go back to Arch or whatever
5/30/21, 4:04 PM - Mehul Srivastava: no I'm not, just clearing that partition, waste of space

5/30/21, 4:12 PM - Mehul Srivastava: selected the folder and then shift delete on win
5/30/21, 4:13 PM - Mehul Srivastava: linux pe just went to windows wala partition and rm
5/30/21, 4:13 PM - Arijit: Arre yaar the way both the things work is way different
5/30/21, 4:13 PM - +91 78689 12384: How about comparing rm on terminal in both üòá

5/30/21, 4:23 PM - +91 87088 21604: No doubt they are
5/30/21, 4:23 PM - +91 87088 21604: BTRFS is made by sun microsystems ig

But it streamlined in v5.4 ig
5/30/21, 4:24 PM - +91 87088 21604: My bad it's oracle
5/30/21, 4:25 PM - +91 87088 21604: I still remember that btrfs  can't have swapfile due to CoW but v5.4 or 5.1 merged it
5/30/21, 4:27 PM - +91 87088 21604: Although ext4 has improved features, it is not a major advance; it uses old technology and is a stop-gap. Ts'o said that Btrfs is the better direction because "it offers improvements in scalability, reliability, and ease of management"

5/30/21, 9:37 PM - +91 83558 14130: I think yes. MIT/Harvard has been working on it as far I remember
5/30/21, 9:38 PM - +91 78689 12384: I thought this was about the language ML for a second
5/30/21, 9:38 PM - +91 78689 12384: I know of decompilers
5/30/21, 9:38 PM - +91 78689 12384: So I guess ML based compilers will also be there

5/30/21, 10:53 PM - +91 6200 548 891: If it is available we can use normal text to assembly language very fast

5/31/21, 10:34 PM - V: The definition is too abstract for me to understand
5/31/21, 10:36 PM - V: Entire Hypothesis testing is very verbose actually
5/31/21, 10:38 PM - +91 90242 35097: Since we're talking about gaussian distributions, I was wondering if gaussian distributions contribute/transcend to logistic maps in any way?

5/31/21, 10:42 PM - V: Well if the sample belongs to a Gaussian distribution it should impact it in some way
5/31/21, 10:43 PM - +91 90242 35097: Wahi!
5/31/21, 10:44 PM - V: But same fact implies for other distributions too
5/31/21, 10:45 PM - V: And logistical map is the graphical representation of the absurdities arising from the unequal dynamics in a non linear equation
5/31/21, 10:46 PM - +91 90242 35097: But gaussian distributions holds a typical relation in logistic map
5/31/21, 10:46 PM - V: Like
5/31/21, 10:48 PM - +91 90242 35097: discrete logistic equation plots a gaussian curve always
5/31/21, 10:48 PM - V: Interesting a discrete equation plots a continuous distribution curve
5/31/21, 10:50 PM - +91 90242 35097: Chaos
5/31/21, 10:50 PM - V: Yes chaos arising from non linear discreet equation plots a continuous distribution curve
5/31/21, 10:53 PM - V: Hmm i think thats because most of the use cases in which there is a presence of a logistical map comprises of samples from a normal distribution
5/31/21, 10:54 PM - V: Logistical maps are in general used in population studies and observing biological behaviour
5/31/21, 10:54 PM - V: Which for a statistical study draw from normal distribution
5/31/21, 10:55 PM - +91 90242 35097: Point!

6/12/21, 11:12 PM - V: Lol people like you are wrong with byjus
6/12/21, 11:12 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Consumer chutiye hai and they are just taking advantage of it
6/12/21, 11:12 PM - Astitva: Well then you need to read up about wework imo
6/12/21, 11:12 PM - Mehul Srivastava: That's what every company does
6/12/21, 11:12 PM - V: Lmao there is something called ethics
6/12/21, 11:12 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Lmao wework best startup ever @917726847461 @919082216009
6/12/21, 11:12 PM - Astitva: The PROBLEM is overvaluation
6/12/21, 11:12 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Capitalism mein there's no ethics
6/12/21, 11:13 PM - Astitva: What they offer is not nearly worth what they are

6/12/21, 11:13 PM - V: Startup culture in india is fucked up maybe
6/12/21, 11:13 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Well I haven't seen the numbers utne sahise but the market opportunity is A LOT and with the whitehat jr we can see they have a lot of leverage on the market
6/12/21, 11:13 PM - Mehul Srivastava: No company cares about ethics
6/12/21, 11:13 PM - Astitva: If you can sell it, shit becomes gold
6/12/21, 11:13 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Exactly
6/12/21, 11:14 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Ans byjus knows how to sell
6/12/21, 11:14 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Nothing wrong with it
6/12/21, 11:14 PM - Astitva: Nobody said there was anything wrong with it
6/12/21, 11:14 PM - Astitva: It's just how the ecosystem and the whole modern economy works at large
6/12/21, 11:14 PM - V: If the qa team at byjus was working properly then maybe i would have agreed with you
6/12/21, 11:14 PM - Astitva: Perception is everything
6/12/21, 11:14 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Bro they're gonna have an ecosystem aage imo and maybe they'll go into traditional system too
6/12/21, 11:15 PM - Gss: Umm , @919717945717  is right , ethics are valuable for not more than 3 credits , binnes rules all
6/12/21, 11:15 PM - +91 78689 12384: I mean if Uber can rack up billions in losses because the low prices it offered to lowball tje competition were heavily subsidized and now it cannot see how to become profitable afaik
6/12/21, 11:15 PM - V: But there is no qa in India
6/12/21, 11:15 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Yesüòé VEG only 3 credit course
6/12/21, 11:15 PM - Astitva: Again the same thing applies to something like Cred, or maybe even Dunzo etc.
6/12/21, 11:15 PM - V: One fucker after another
6/12/21, 11:15 PM - +91 78689 12384: I don't even understand how Uber keeps getting funded. Must be something there of course
6/12/21, 11:16 PM - Gss: No shit truer than this was ever told in this group .
6/12/21, 11:16 PM - Astitva: Truth. Real. Unfiltered Truth
6/12/21, 11:16 PM - Mehul Srivastava: The only way uber can become profitable is by becoming a monopoly which in a market like that, they can't
6/12/21, 11:16 PM - +91 78689 12384: Potential profits maybe but the company CEO himself said that profitability mau never happened
6/12/21, 11:16 PM - Astitva: They're going down slowly bruh
6/12/21, 11:16 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yeah exactly, I don't get how you can continuously run a loss making business without any expectation of profitability
6/12/21, 11:16 PM - Astitva: Uber has become a pawn in the game where every piece is controlled by Softbank
6/12/21, 11:17 PM - V: Lol so to do start up in india is to scam people thats rich
6/12/21, 11:17 PM - +91 78689 12384: I mean there was some hope maybe when they started looking into removing drivers through self driving taxis but that is a long way off
6/12/21, 11:17 PM - Astitva: They can dispose of it if they felt like it
6/12/21, 11:17 PM - Gss: User base aka sheep as fodder
6/12/21, 11:17 PM - +91 78689 12384: Sure sounds good, what to do with the userbase?
6/12/21, 11:18 PM - Astitva: Lyft is doing a better job betting on eliminating private ownership structure of the automotive industry
6/12/21, 11:18 PM - Gss: They have the majority , first movers , blah blah
6/12/21, 11:19 PM - V: Of all the companies who had to fund byjus the majority of funds were given by @919717945717 workplace of the year
6/12/21, 11:19 PM - +91 78689 12384: Yeah yeah, I get those arguments, I'm just saying it is a bit weird to keep throwing money at it over vague notions of connecting its userbase to profitavility in the future
6/12/21, 11:20 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Lol
6/12/21, 11:20 PM - Astitva: Worked for Amazon
6/12/21, 11:20 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Uber wasn't the first

6/12/21, 11:20 PM - Gss: <Media omitted>
6/12/21, 11:21 PM - +91 78689 12384: Amazon wasn't unprofitable because it couldn't be profitable, it was because they were reinvesting all the profits back into hypergrowth for the first 10 years. With Uber it is different, their costs alone make profitability nearly impossible (at least form what I know)
6/12/21, 11:21 PM - Mehul Srivastava: https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ridecharge

This was the first I think
6/12/21, 11:21 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Actually it's really rare that the first company succeeds
6/12/21, 11:22 PM - Astitva: I'm talking about sheer profit potential. Amazon used economies of scale to its advantage, uber hasn't been able to tap into thag because of its flawed business model
6/12/21, 11:23 PM - Astitva: It's all about barriers to entry tbh
6/12/21, 11:23 PM - Gss: What's better though?  For the company and the user ?
6/12/21, 11:23 PM - Gss: It still has revenue right ?
6/12/21, 11:23 PM - Astitva: Amazon built the biggest delivery network in the world (after ups or fedx ig) that's what worked for them
6/12/21, 11:23 PM - Gss: Are you daying there are certain things you can't put on the internet ?
6/12/21, 11:24 PM - Astitva: It's simple economics bro u need to find a balance between costs and revenues in the *long run*
6/12/21, 11:24 PM - Astitva: No.
6/12/21, 11:24 PM - V: Microsoft :yes
6/12/21, 11:25 PM - Astitva: It's near impossible to replicate the scale of Amazon's delivery channel but very easy to set up an aggregator network like uber
6/12/21, 11:25 PM - Astitva: @917726847461
6/12/21, 11:25 PM - Astitva: Very meaning comparatively
6/12/21, 11:25 PM - Gss: Cost of acquiring customers is too high in this case .
Something gotta chamge in this equation , i feel it comin , may it be the consumer , the payment , the car , the driver , the app , something
6/12/21, 11:26 PM - Astitva: It's the worst for the drivers man wait I'll share a vid that explains it beautifully
6/12/21, 11:26 PM - Astitva: That's why I said it's business model is flawed and not optimal for the long run
6/12/21, 11:27 PM - Astitva: https://youtu.be/fgQPj90OrQE
6/12/21, 11:27 PM - Astitva: Watch this!!!
6/12/21, 11:27 PM - V: Or get a super powerful ir team who knows how to mint from investors fuck the laws of economics
6/12/21, 11:31 PM - Astitva: Look all the businesses that you see that have been around for a century or so, they all have one thing in common, they have recurring revenue streams. It's like fossil fuels vs renewable energy. You can't expect to continue if you know your business will eventually run out of stream (meaning cash) as soon as it's time to become a real business, as opposed to a cash dump
6/12/21, 11:35 PM - V: All businesses will run out of steam if they stay the same they change according to trend but other than that ability they are same as laxmi chit fund
6/12/21, 11:36 PM - V: Microsoft is the best of the bunch imo as it has mastered the art of conversion of a successful business into a cash dump

6/13/21, 9:25 PM - V: Not just fb and google everyone needs money
6/13/21, 9:25 PM - Astitva: My point exactly
6/13/21, 9:26 PM - Astitva: You just can't rely too much on charitable donations for doing work on the scale that they do
6/13/21, 9:28 PM - V: Not to mention the fact even among open source software these companies put out the most finished products
6/13/21, 9:28 PM - V: Its sort of a indirect monopoly on that front too
6/13/21, 9:29 PM - Astitva: Yeah exactly. Everyone needs money. Even people who say they don't care about money need money. So naturally, those who know how to make tons of it will end up ruling the industry

6/14/21, 10:59 AM - V: look*
6/14/21, 11:00 AM - +91 87088 21604: BTW you using on Wayland right???
How much stable is Wayland and Pipewire???
6/14/21, 11:00 AM - V: Its stable
6/14/21, 11:00 AM - V: But i don't think pipewire is any advantage over alsa
6/14/21, 11:00 AM - +91 87088 21604: üòíüòíüòí
It meant for mortalsü•∏
6/14/21, 11:01 AM - V: Both are bs
6/14/21, 11:01 AM - +91 87088 21604: It's not meant to replace alsa it's replacement to jack pulseaudio and sndio
6/14/21, 11:01 AM - V: Wasn't there a pipewire-alsa package
6/14/21, 11:02 AM - +91 87088 21604: Alsa will be there forever because they just sit on alsa with virtual cards and all
6/14/21, 11:02 AM - V: Kill alsa please
6/14/21, 11:02 AM - V: Alsa is the most bs sound architecture
6/14/21, 11:03 AM - V: One of the things that works good on windows and macos is sound
6/14/21, 11:03 AM - V: Proprietary drivers rock

This are deps for Pipewire and it depends on some alsa libs
6/14/21, 11:04 AM - +91 87088 21604: It's baked into kernel it's hard to kill
6/14/21, 11:04 AM - +91 87088 21604: Yah sadly
6/14/21, 11:04 AM - +91 78689 12384: What's wrong with it ü§î
6/14/21, 11:04 AM - V: Bluetooth connectivity issues and in general poor sound quality
6/14/21, 11:04 AM - V: Like 40 percent of original volume
6/14/21, 11:05 AM - +91 78689 12384: Hmm haven't compared volume of windows and linux, will try and see
6/14/21, 11:05 AM - +91 78689 12384: Bluetooth issues I also face
6/14/21, 11:05 AM - V: Take my word for it windows is infinitesimally better
6/14/21, 11:06 AM - +91 78689 12384: But I face connectivity issues, once it is connected, sound is fine. So probably due to bluetooth drivers rather than alsa
6/14/21, 11:06 AM - +91 87088 21604: He is right actually.
Actually it's standalone isn't that much usable.
Moreover apps made for linux these days support pulseaudio only.
And alsa itself hate multichannel
6/14/21, 11:06 AM - +91 78689 12384: So pulseaudio is multiplexing over alsa only right?
6/14/21, 11:06 AM - V: Everything over alsa is bs
6/14/21, 11:07 AM - +91 87088 21604: Yess
6/14/21, 11:07 AM - +91 87088 21604: Hope Pipewire will change your perspective üòÇ
6/14/21, 11:07 AM - V: alsa is like a weak foundation of mega building
6/14/21, 11:07 AM - V: It doesn't
6/14/21, 11:07 AM - V: Wired audio is fine
6/14/21, 11:07 AM - V: But wireless is where the issues are
6/14/21, 11:08 AM - +91 87088 21604: AFAIK connectivity is handled by bluez rather than Alsa
I never faced Bluetooth issue in void tho
6/14/21, 11:09 AM - V: not connectivity
6/14/21, 11:09 AM - V: Wireless audio is very low in general
6/14/21, 11:09 AM - +91 87088 21604: There're people on reddit who only use dwm alsa and dbus and just tui programs
6/14/21, 11:09 AM - V: Connectivity to you can change in bluetooth.conf
6/14/21, 11:10 AM - +91 87088 21604: And they got no chilp
6/14/21, 11:10 AM - +91 87088 21604: *chill
6/14/21, 11:10 AM - +91 87088 21604: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
6/14/21, 11:10 AM - +91 87088 21604: /etc/
???
6/14/21, 11:10 AM - V: Yes /etc/main/bluetooth.conf
6/14/21, 11:11 AM - +91 87088 21604: Ig it's /etc/bluetooth/main.conf
6/14/21, 11:11 AM - V: whatever it maybe
6/14/21, 11:11 AM - V: I just change the connectivity from dual to bredr and it connects just fine
6/14/21, 11:12 AM - V: The issue is after connecting volume drops low
6/14/21, 11:12 AM - +91 87088 21604: ü§îü§îü§î
Use pulseaudio maybe
6/14/21, 11:13 AM - V: It was an issue in pulse audio now it is an issue in pipewire-pulse too
6/14/21, 11:13 AM - +91 87088 21604: For me pulse works fine these days..
I used to have problem that sets my volume to 0 for every channel on startup
6/14/21, 11:14 AM - +91 87088 21604: Lol!!
They're working on removing deps for pulseaudio.
6/14/21, 11:14 AM - +91 87088 21604: I hope Pipewire will be usable in everyday purpose maybe by end of this year
6/14/21, 11:14 AM - +91 87088 21604: @919315996705 
You tried any WM in Wayland???
6/14/21, 11:14 AM - V: No
6/14/21, 11:15 AM - V: I said it na
6/14/21, 11:15 AM - V: Gnome is very versatile now
6/14/21, 11:15 AM - V: It also has a tiling mode also
6/14/21, 11:15 AM - +91 87088 21604: Umm so you committed to it now...
6/14/21, 11:16 AM - +91 87088 21604: Good good üëç
6/14/21, 11:16 AM - V: I love gnome 40 yeah the improvement has some quality of life changes
6/14/21, 11:16 AM - V: xfce and kde need to up their ante
6/14/21, 11:17 AM - +91 98185 62450: Gnome is lovely
6/14/21, 11:17 AM - +91 98185 62450: chef's kiss
6/14/21, 11:17 AM - +91 87088 21604: The top is what makes GNOME GNOME
6/14/21, 11:17 AM - +91 87088 21604: *top bar
6/14/21, 11:18 AM - V: i didn't care initially about desktop environments but gnome is a refined experience.
6/14/21, 11:19 AM - +91 87088 21604: Kde is meant to be extremely customizable whereas xfce meant for low end hardware.
And they're best in their purpose

And wait for KDE to switch to QT6, it'll be a big update
6/14/21, 11:19 AM - +91 87088 21604: Yah GNOME is more modernn
6/14/21, 11:19 AM - +91 87088 21604: Yips ‚ù§Ô∏è
6/14/21, 11:19 AM - V: Kde 5 is coming ig
6/14/21, 11:19 AM - +91 98185 62450: yar i feel user level pe Gnome is just as customizable
6/14/21, 11:19 AM - +91 98185 62450: w extensions and wat not
6/14/21, 11:19 AM - +91 98185 62450: kde 5.12 chalraha abhi
6/14/21, 11:20 AM - +91 87088 21604: Kde 5 üòë is plasma bro
6/14/21, 11:20 AM - V: Newer version of that
6/14/21, 11:20 AM - +91 87088 21604: Actually Gnome devs don't want it to be customizable but community forced it and that tweak app is just gui to dconf
6/14/21, 11:20 AM - V: Kde plasma 5.22
6/14/21, 11:21 AM - +91 87088 21604: It's already shipped
6/14/21, 11:21 AM - +91 87088 21604: Wait for Qt 6
6/14/21, 11:21 AM - +91 87088 21604: I love GNOME apps like nautilus and maps
6/14/21, 11:21 AM - V: Files lol
6/14/21, 11:22 AM - +91 87088 21604: It's de facto after dolphin and thunarüòÇ
6/14/21, 11:23 AM - V: I don't use it that much too comfortable in terminal now
6/14/21, 11:24 AM - +91 87088 21604: I use dired most of the time
6/14/21, 11:24 AM - V: Never used emacs
6/14/21, 11:24 AM - +91 98185 62450: KDE settings are far superior though
6/14/21, 11:24 AM - +91 98185 62450: Gnome settings se
6/14/21, 11:25 AM - +91 98185 62450: like the keyboard shortcuts are just ü•µ
6/14/21, 11:25 AM - +91 87088 21604: No doubt they are superior than ever
6/14/21, 11:25 AM - +91 87088 21604: U must
6/14/21, 11:25 AM - V: Text editor ke liye i use atom with latex for note taking
6/14/21, 11:25 AM - V: Latex works wonders
6/14/21, 11:25 AM - +91 98185 62450: this. Gnome has very nice naming of stock apps
6/14/21, 11:26 AM - +91 98185 62450: ha bhai mene Dolphin mein files manage karli ab Kate mein note likhunga
6/14/21, 11:26 AM - +91 98185 62450: what happened to "Files" and "Text Editor"?üò≠
6/14/21, 11:26 AM - +91 87088 21604: Try https://orgmode.org
6/14/21, 11:27 AM - +91 87088 21604: You mean gedit????
6/14/21, 11:27 AM - +91 87088 21604: I read somewhere that atom development is declining
6/14/21, 11:27 AM - V: He is taking about naming schemes
6/14/21, 11:28 AM - V: It is such a good text editor
6/14/21, 11:28 AM - V: Very good plugins also
6/14/21, 11:28 AM - +91 87088 21604: Ohh!
But it's moreof a application name rather than package name whatever Gnome human guidelines are way better than any others
6/14/21, 11:29 AM - +91 87088 21604: I used it for a while.
It's aesthetically pleasing
6/14/21, 11:29 AM - +91 87088 21604: Afterall it's Electron appü§≠ü§≠
6/14/21, 11:30 AM - V: It is better than vs code in what it does
6/14/21, 11:30 AM - +91 87088 21604: Maybe can't say abt that..
These days I use completion on demand
6/14/21, 11:31 AM - V: I prefer ide in general for work so i want visual studio linux port so bad but this is good too
6/14/21, 11:32 AM - +91 87088 21604: Which port are you talking about???
6/14/21, 11:32 AM - V: Visual studio ide
6/14/21, 11:32 AM - V: Need a linux port of it
6/14/21, 11:33 AM - +91 87088 21604: Oops
6/14/21, 11:33 AM - +91 87088 21604: Why you need that proprietary shit???
6/14/21, 11:33 AM - V: Because its good
6/14/21, 11:33 AM - +91 78689 12384: Visual Studio is really good tbh
6/14/21, 11:34 AM - +91 78689 12384: It isn't about blindly being against proprietary, one has to acknowledge if the entire package it provides it convenient and really good
6/14/21, 11:34 AM - +91 87088 21604: I used a little for C++
6/14/21, 11:34 AM - +91 78689 12384: *is
6/14/21, 11:34 AM - +91 87088 21604: Absolutely
6/14/21, 11:34 AM - V: C++ development on visual studio is ü§§ü§§
6/14/21, 11:34 AM - +91 87088 21604: Yah and then cmake and ninja üòåüòå
6/14/21, 11:34 AM - +91 78689 12384: It has great tools for monitoring performance also, sure one can use a profiler and then check the flamegraph or something but can't beat it being right there while it is running
6/14/21, 11:35 AM - +91 87088 21604: Wowowww never dig too deep in it sounds nice
6/14/21, 11:35 AM - +91 78689 12384: Debugging experience is also quite good but on Linux I have only used gdb and never integrated with VS Code so maybe VS Code debugging is also good
6/14/21, 11:35 AM - V: Mostly i love it for how complete of a package it is
6/14/21, 11:35 AM - V: You don't have to go anywhere
6/14/21, 11:35 AM - V: Just start working
6/14/21, 11:36 AM - +91 87088 21604: Sounds more like a promise from jetbrainsüòÇ
6/14/21, 11:36 AM - V: CLion is also good but paid
6/14/21, 11:36 AM - +91 87088 21604: I used lldb with vscode it works
6/14/21, 11:37 AM - +91 87088 21604: Every jetbrains product is paid other than community edition

6/14/21, 11:38 AM - +91 78689 12384: nice, it supports hover and inspect state, skipping code paths?
6/14/21, 11:38 AM - +91 87088 21604: Yes yes it does
6/14/21, 11:38 AM - +91 78689 12384: I have heard that Visual Studio debugger is better for threaded applications but cannot comment on it
6/14/21, 11:39 AM - +91 87088 21604: Don't know about that but lldb works fine
6/14/21, 11:39 AM - V: Whats the point if it doesn't

6/14/21, 11:41 AM - +91 78689 12384: wdym? Haven't set it up with VS Code so manually type which line to put the breakpoint in , etc
6/14/21, 11:41 AM - +91 78689 12384: not too bad but tedious af

6/14/21, 12:10 PM - V: Have you tried uninstalling wsl and then opening it

6/14/21, 12:10 PM - +91 83558 14130: It's a bit like TF1 glued together
6/14/21, 12:11 PM - +91 83558 14130: Will take 3 years to become stable

6/14/21, 12:13 PM - V: Now at this point Microsoft has no shame in copying from apple down to their naming scheme
6/14/21, 12:14 PM - V: Are ask @919717945717 he is making Microsoft tech support guy making minimum wage at hq in Bangalore

6/20/21, 11:58 AM - V: to optimise and improve performance across the board
6/20/21, 11:58 AM - +91 87088 21604: yahh

6/20/21, 12:01 PM - V: don't mind arm is cool and all but its barebones to work with and whoever uses it needs to build their tools around it from scratch

6/20/21, 12:07 PM - +91 87088 21604: I'll also commend Google for that, mainly in software but they tried a lot

6/20/21, 12:12 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yay
What're they best at its Chrome, Android, and defacto Search Engine..
+ Google cloud platform too

Other than that, they ultimately fail or don't get that much profit.

6/20/21, 4:43 PM - V: From what i found out by using it is that this is good but lacks some quality of life improvements atom and vsc provide
6/20/21, 4:44 PM - V: One major issue is it doesn't have the feature to change your directory at will
6/20/21, 4:46 PM - +91 87088 21604: https://github.com/rxi/lite-plugins

@919315996705 
You can look at already made plugins.
I haven't digged that much deep in that.
Just satisfied with Emacs.
But ig there'll be some core API which you can access through Lua.
6/20/21, 4:46 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yah same..
Make a nerdtree plzz
6/20/21, 4:46 PM - V: I have looked at them but it isn't enough
6/20/21, 4:47 PM - +91 87088 21604: You can start lite $HOME like that then file explorer will show everything
6/20/21, 4:47 PM - +91 87088 21604: Will tell you if I find something
6/20/21, 4:48 PM - V: Mostly my issue with this is the lack of latex renderer
6/20/21, 4:48 PM - V: I have shifted almost my entire notes workflow on latex
6/20/21, 4:49 PM - V: It has the plugin for recognising latex syntax
6/20/21, 5:13 PM - +91 87088 21604: I'll permanently shift to it if it got some org and lsp support...
It's fantastico in every terms
6/20/21, 5:14 PM - V: Yes its snappy but lacks proper support
6/20/21, 5:14 PM - +91 87088 21604: Noice!!

What do you use now for latex???
6/20/21, 5:14 PM - V: Atom
6/20/21, 5:14 PM - V: A set of latex plugins
6/20/21, 5:14 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yah it's like micro.. :(
6/20/21, 5:14 PM - +91 87088 21604: Umm nice nice
6/20/21, 5:15 PM - +91 87088 21604: Make PR maybe for full documentation

6/20/21, 5:16 PM - V: Used texmaker before its so bland typing on it makes me wanna kms
6/20/21, 5:18 PM - +91 87088 21604: Lol
By far Emacs has the good support for latex katex org and what not..
6/20/21, 5:19 PM - V: I have been using atom for almost everything now used vs code before but not that good

@919315996705 
See this it's just a plain lua file with control flow statements..

But I'm quite sure a plugin for latex will look more complex than this
6/20/21, 5:20 PM - +91 87088 21604: Good
6/20/21, 5:21 PM - +91 87088 21604: BTW which code formatter do you use???!

6/20/21, 5:23 PM - V: Beautifier
6/20/21, 5:23 PM - V: For javascript related code
6/20/21, 5:24 PM - V: For python using jupyterlab

6/22/21, 9:29 PM - +91 83558 14130: @919315996705  you were asking me why I hate Windows right. I will tell you why because randomly stupid bugs appear out of nowhere like my Laptop Camera suddenly stopped working lmao. There are so many bugs but fortunately Windows have a support team tbh.
6/22/21, 9:37 PM - +91 78689 12384: I've been having lots of issues with bluetooth on Linux Mint and the Sound GUI so grass is brown everywhere. Except maybe MacOS. Because I haven't used it
6/22/21, 9:38 PM - +91 78689 12384: Though should try other distros too
6/22/21, 9:38 PM - V: Lmao try pop os
6/22/21, 9:38 PM - +91 78689 12384: maybe they are better
6/22/21, 9:39 PM - V: Windows is ok but Microsoft pareshan bohot karta hai
6/22/21, 9:39 PM - +91 83558 14130: Windows though can't beat it. Especially because I find it easier to solve any bug which occurs in WSL or in Linux env
6/22/21, 9:39 PM - Arijit: A quick reinstalling of drivers solve most of the issues
6/22/21, 9:39 PM - V: I miss visual studio tbvh
6/22/21, 9:39 PM - +91 83558 14130: Not everytime
6/22/21, 9:39 PM - +91 83558 14130: VS Code is good tbh
6/22/21, 9:39 PM - V: Also unreal engine 5 try karna hai ü•≤
6/22/21, 9:39 PM - +91 83558 14130: But still bugs lmao
6/22/21, 9:41 PM - V: The best answer for this beef is use whatever you want others can go fuck themselves
6/22/21, 9:41 PM - +91 83558 14130: Bugs on Linux are frustrating too no doubt, but we at least have more community support and thus we can understand. On Windows though sometimes it's clueless
6/22/21, 9:41 PM - +91 91652 57248: That is the main reason I use windows
6/22/21, 9:41 PM - +91 83558 14130: Yea true. Just saying though. Not forcing anyonw to use anything.
6/22/21, 9:42 PM - +91 91652 57248: Visual studio has no match tbh, clion is good but i felt that it's actually a bit slower than VS
6/22/21, 9:45 PM - +91 83558 14130: Yes

I'm a fresh Senior SWE in the Technical Infrastructure group, full of smiles and cheer and a desire to help out where I can. I'm sitting next to an awfully ornery fellow from the Go team who seems to spend most of his day on the phone with his broker.

One day he's fucking around with some awk, a nasty script of several dozen lines, more awk than I'd ever seen in one place. He's cursing up a storm. I lean over and say, "hey man, you know Brian Kernighan is two floors above us. He's the K in awk. And Aho is right down the street at Columbia! That's two thirds of the awk trilogy right there! They could set you right, I'm sure."

He looked at me with intense hate. "I'm Peter Weinberger. I'm the W in awk."

Not skipping a beat, I replied "I guess you're fucked then, Weinberger!" and skipped outside to smoke a Newport."

7/3/21, 2:32 AM - +91 86691 45213: lmao. can someone confirm and explain this: Secure Boot with dual boot manjaro-windows works after I added boot partition's efi file (grub) as "trusted" in BIOS (Acer).

It works, I was able to boot into both windows and manjaro with secure boot enabled, but why?

7/3/21, 8:08 AM - +91 87088 21604: Because it works like that..

You verified Manjaro's efi boot entry manually thru firmware
7/3/21, 10:34 AM - +91 86691 45213: But shouldn't efi file be signed with Microsoft's key for Secure Boot to pass.
7/3/21, 10:35 AM - +91 87088 21604: No no..
You can sign with your own keys too with shim
7/3/21, 10:35 AM - +91 86691 45213: I read the Secure Boot variables, there were 3 entries. Acer, Microsoft and Linpus Lite

7/5/21, 3:31 PM - +91 83558 14130: why such a big disparity? Is it because C++ is just way to optimized and mature?
7/5/21, 3:42 PM - +91 78689 12384: I don't see the point of comparing the two numbers, they have acknowledged in the paper that they too are new to Rust and that their Rust implementation uses different high level decisions from the C++ implementation so obviously performance disparities would be there irrespective of knowledge
7/5/21, 3:42 PM - +91 78689 12384: If they took the same Rust design and implemented it in C++ then the numbers would make some sense

8/13/21, 9:18 PM - +91 87088 21604: Docker basically runs in userspace and uses host OS kernel
So how can this be native?
8/13/21, 9:19 PM - +91 99204 65790: Hmm
8/13/21, 9:59 PM - Rishabh: MacOS does not use boot2docker but it‚Äôs own hypervisor for deploying containers.
8/13/21, 9:59 PM - Rishabh: With M1 some people claim to run Linux natively.
8/13/21, 10:12 PM - +91 87088 21604: Yup I'm aware about that v5.13 brings support for M1 chips.

But how running linux on docker runs it natively?
8/13/21, 10:17 PM - +91 87088 21604: Well boot2docker is already deprecated.
And AFAIK docker don't use hypervisor, VMs use hypervisor so they can exposes CPU, RAM, network and disk resources to the VMs.

And that's how VM manager takes over the CPU ring 0 or root mode(this days) and intercepts all privileged calls made by the guest OS to create the illusion that the guest OS has its own hardware.
8/13/21, 10:18 PM - +91 87088 21604: Well you maybe talking about past, when docker used to use LxC(linux container) which are now replaced by runC for application containerization
8/15/21, 12:22 AM - Rishabh: I don't know enough to comment, have to study more about it.

8/17/21, 6:01 PM - +91 83558 14130: Not gonna lie @919082216009  bur the apple earphones that used to come (or still come idk if they do) weren't bad lol
8/17/21, 6:02 PM - V: They were worst lol
8/17/21, 6:02 PM - +91 83558 14130: yea sony isn't great.I would suggest Sennheiser, best sound quality . Bose earphones are good too balanced across all genres but especially good for those with lyrics
8/17/21, 6:03 PM - +91 83558 14130: Idk better the sony lol
8/17/21, 6:03 PM - V: Ok

8/17/21, 6:06 PM - V: Airpods are earphones for casual they are just normal in everything only issue i have with them is they don't fit easily in my ear and tend to fall
8/17/21, 6:08 PM - V: I have been using sony's for the past year and bought the new model i have yet to see anything come close in the 15-20k price range
8/17/21, 6:08 PM - +91 83558 14130: I don't mean Airpods
8/17/21, 6:08 PM - +91 83558 14130: I mean the wired ones which come in the dabba
8/17/21, 6:09 PM - V: Bruh earpods bol na
8/17/21, 6:09 PM - +91 83558 14130: Haan sorry

8/17/21, 6:22 PM - +91 84490 15296: I've heard they might launch qc45 soon there were some renders .. qc series needs a new fix
8/17/21, 6:23 PM - Rishabh: Yeah but new products INR price is ridiculous.

8/17/21, 7:23 PM - +91 90242 35097: Airpods Pro
8/17/21, 7:24 PM - +91 90242 35097: They‚Äôre just handy, sound quality is mostly balanced with lil bias on the bass side, noise cancellation not good, but in such a small design it has miraculous effect
8/17/21, 7:25 PM - +91 84490 15296: Bruh.. they don't shut down until you keep them back onto the case
8/17/21, 7:25 PM - +91 90242 35097: Although I‚Äôd prefer 1000XM4 any day for sound quality but still
8/17/21, 7:25 PM - +91 84490 15296: It's pure metal and heavy
8/17/21, 7:25 PM - +91 90242 35097: Airpods?
8/17/21, 7:26 PM - +91 84490 15296: Ahh my bad I thought you meant max
8/17/21, 7:26 PM - +91 90242 35097: Also, if you‚Äôre talking about airpods, it doesn‚Äôt matter much, battery is relatively good
8/17/21, 7:26 PM - +91 90242 35097: Na na, they‚Äôre good but still XM4s are better imo
8/17/21, 7:42 PM - V: Airpods are podcast earphones

8/17/21, 7:49 PM - Rishabh: Yeah
8/17/21, 7:56 PM - +91 90242 35097: Good enough, works around 4.5 hrs with ANC on, and charges fast too
8/17/21, 7:56 PM - +91 90242 35097: Yeah but not at par with what should be, but be considerate of the size also
8/17/21, 7:59 PM - V: Airpods don't have anc afaik
8/17/21, 7:59 PM - +91 90242 35097: Pro does

8/17/21, 8:00 PM - +91 90242 35097: Ironically 1 has better battery life than pro xD
8/17/21, 8:00 PM - V: I have them they are the least comfortable earphones
8/17/21, 8:00 PM - +91 90242 35097: Pros?

8/17/21, 8:01 PM - +91 90242 35097: Yeah doesn‚Äôt fit everyone‚Äôs ear perfect
8/17/21, 8:01 PM - +91 90242 35097: Personally I‚Äôve had issues with them
8/17/21, 8:01 PM - V: I don't know what were they smoking but not including rubber tips with earphones makes them cheap and uncomfortable
8/17/21, 8:01 PM - +91 90242 35097: ^havent
8/17/21, 8:02 PM - +91 90242 35097: Apple strats bruv, therefore to fill that problem they introduced pros
8/17/21, 8:02 PM - V: Well i would have liked them if so ny didn't make  true wireless earphones
8/17/21, 8:03 PM - +91 90242 35097: Those are good but at the end it‚Äôs about the ecosystem that holds
8/17/21, 8:04 PM - +91 90242 35097: The seamless connectivity and experience.
8/17/21, 8:04 PM - V: Yeah they work good with macbook but act as normal earphones with android
8/17/21, 8:05 PM - +91 90242 35097: Oh you‚Äôre on Android? Then toh Sony is the obv choice
8/17/21, 8:06 PM - V: Iphones are my least favorite apple product

8/17/21, 8:08 PM - +91 90242 35097: Ahh I see, makes sense xD
8/17/21, 8:09 PM - +91 90242 35097: Generally speaking, watch is good, very precise and good functionality

9/8/21, 12:05 AM - V: Bruh now i realise Pytorch is a mess on new macs
9/8/21, 12:06 AM - V: Its entire idea was built upon cuda support for acceleration of  computation
9/8/21, 12:07 AM - V: Apple said no u to nvidia way back
9/8/21, 12:08 AM - V: Which makes the neural engine in the m1 a wasted opportunity
9/8/21, 12:08 AM - V: Tho apple modified tensorflow themselves it works so much better
9/8/21, 12:09 AM - +91 83558 14130: Apple sucks
9/8/21, 12:10 AM - +91 83558 14130: Microsoft way better. They have Guido Van Rossum and literally maintain PyTorch for Windows lol
9/8/21, 12:10 AM - +91 83558 14130: Lmao ur alive
9/8/21, 12:12 AM - V: More like Pytorch team didn't expect m1 tensorflow works like magic on m1
9/8/21, 12:12 AM - +91 83558 14130: Also that. They will find a fix later on for sure though
9/8/21, 12:12 AM - V: It has been an year bruh
9/8/21, 12:13 AM - +91 83558 14130: Btw Microsoft also did some optimizations for Tf for WSL i Believe
9/8/21, 12:13 AM - V: Do you how much pain in the ass run fastai library is in general
9/8/21, 12:13 AM - +91 83558 14130: Just use Nvidia :(
9/8/21, 12:13 AM - +91 83558 14130: I can understand
9/8/21, 12:15 AM - V: Na i am okay with tensorflow now tbh i was hesitant at first but its great too
9/8/21, 12:16 AM - +91 83558 14130: TF is a fucking mess
9/8/21, 12:16 AM - +91 83558 14130: So many fucking branches and scraped versions and experimental features
9/8/21, 12:16 AM - +91 83558 14130: TF2 is fine but running old Tf is a pain daamn
9/8/21, 12:17 AM - V: I am talking tf2.6
9/8/21, 12:17 AM - +91 83558 14130: Also PyTorch has a lot more stuff added
9/8/21, 12:17 AM - +91 83558 14130: 0.6 wheb was this releaed btw last year?
9/8/21, 12:19 AM - V: 2.6 is the latest version not 2.06
9/8/21, 12:19 AM - +91 83558 14130: Ohh cool . haven't done dl for a while
9/8/21, 12:19 AM - +91 83558 14130: But i suspect Google be using Jax for everything these days.
9/8/21, 12:21 AM - V: They made a new library for competing with pytorch
9/8/21, 12:21 AM - +91 83558 14130: Yupp
9/8/21, 12:21 AM - V: It literally has all the stuff Pytorch had when it launched 2016 against tensorflow 1
9/8/21, 12:22 AM - +91 83558 14130: And it has so many extension libraries , like a complete ecosystem. (DeepMind mad eit I think and had beeb using it closed source for some time I believe?)

9/8/21, 10:02 PM - +91 83558 14130: üòÇ
9/8/21, 10:03 PM - V: Tho still why sigmoid
9/8/21, 10:03 PM - +91 83558 14130: Or me figuring out why the fuck does Python languages design sucks
9/8/21, 10:03 PM - V: Literally there are many non linear activation layers available
9/8/21, 10:03 PM - +91 83558 14130: Gradient vanishing, clipping wagera prevent karta hoga na
9/8/21, 10:04 PM - +91 83558 14130: + somerhing to do with Information Gain(entropy shit)
9/8/21, 10:04 PM - V: Bruh clipping is the prevention for exploding gradient
9/8/21, 10:04 PM - V: Aur voh to relu bhi karta hai
9/8/21, 10:04 PM - +91 83558 14130: Han wahi I meant those anomalies (not clipping sorry )
9/8/21, 10:05 PM - +91 83558 14130: Ok
9/8/21, 10:08 PM - V: Also why do they initialise the weight matrix in the network to an identity matrix and why not random
9/8/21, 10:08 PM - V: Isn't randomisation considered an effective way to prevent bias
9/8/21, 10:10 PM - +91 83558 14130: Then I think this: 1. Easy to compute derivative. 2. Range bounded hai . 3. Approx Gaussian type hi hai and acc DL book Gaussian js best for preserving information
9/8/21, 10:11 PM - +91 83558 14130: Yup, ok here's some perspective
9/8/21, 10:11 PM - V: Yeah but if this is true then why the heck we start from random weights in descent
9/8/21, 10:12 PM - V: The goal is to find parameters with lowest loss
9/8/21, 10:13 PM - +91 83558 14130: Weight matrices are essentially be considered as starting points in multidim search space .
Now starting from a random point wouldn't always he great.
How about some intialization scheme helps me converge faster?
It's like a small prior knowledge (though not really) , which helps in better traversal through the multidimensional space.
9/8/21, 10:14 PM - +91 83558 14130: It becomes harder and harder as n-dim increases.
9/8/21, 10:14 PM - V: Derivative is the entire problem here by the time the error reaches to the inital layer at the time step there are already too many computations via bptt
9/8/21, 10:15 PM - +91 83558 14130: but haan convex hai toh maybe they found some eqns or relations which helps rel to convergence in that space.
9/8/21, 10:16 PM - +91 83558 14130: Haan woh toh hoga hi. Then you might ask why do we use Transfer Learning? Isn't that learnable parameters/weights as well.
9/8/21, 10:17 PM - V: But we are removing the end layer in that and tuning it to our parameters
9/8/21, 10:17 PM - +91 83558 14130: that's finetuning
9/8/21, 10:17 PM - V: Plus that has its issues too like catastrophic forgetting
9/8/21, 10:17 PM - +91 83558 14130: you can chose not to train the learned weighta
9/8/21, 10:17 PM - +91 83558 14130: freeze=True(i think this parameter) in Keras
9/8/21, 10:17 PM - +91 83558 14130: This message was deleted
9/8/21, 10:18 PM - V: Transfer learning has an issue of catastrophic forgetting in which we train a model specific to our task so it forgets what its original task was
9/8/21, 10:19 PM - +91 83558 14130: Haan ,but most of these GPT-3 /BERT type models tbh have seen a lot lmao. So anything we train on would be a subset of the domain on which they trained on it already.
If still forgetting occurs, some samples from the original domain can be added to our set
9/8/21, 10:20 PM - V: Wouldn't doing that frequently result in overfitting and not generalizing
9/8/21, 10:20 PM - +91 83558 14130: Not really, but still worst case it forgets then:
9/8/21, 10:21 PM - +91 83558 14130: Incremental training/learning, where you yake the orig set+ your set. then orig set+yourold+your new. continue
9/8/21, 10:23 PM - +91 83558 14130: I mean current models like GPT2/3 are so well generalized which is why they perform well on downstream tasks via finetuning
9/8/21, 10:23 PM - V: Also in general sense isn't forgetting like a good thing for the model
9/8/21, 10:23 PM - +91 83558 14130: This would be more of a problem for smaller models and  Word2Vec,GloVe type tbh
9/8/21, 10:24 PM - +91 83558 14130: Maybe depends on the context. Generally if the two sets of data are disjont then Ig forgetting will happen.
But you don't want it to forget what it already knows na, or else it will be like training from scratch XD
9/8/21, 10:25 PM - V: Thats why rnn discard useless info

9/12/21, 1:43 PM - +91 88794 07747: Could someone help me with understanding some of the mistakes I might be making when considering how a simple Digit Recognizing API might work. I have tried using a FastAPI backend with Python, and a canvas to enable the client to draw an image.
1. It seems that the model is deeply biased towards the number 5, in the limited examples I've tried (even in a blank canvas, it gets a probability of 0.7).What might be the reason for this bias towards 5, or is it just random?.
2. The 3 layer Linear NN, got 97% accuracy on the test set, but doesn't seem to perform on these real world examples. It seems evident that a CNN might have much better results on these real world examples, also taking into account the randomness of the location of the digits and also the downsampling of the canvas image. What might be some other factors for this discrepancy in the test accuracy and the real world examples?
3. Are there any better alternatives than using base64 for the POST requests? (I have considered using blob, but base64 doesn't seem to have much of a performance hurdle)
9/12/21, 1:43 PM - +91 88794 07747: GitHub Repo: https://github.com/Vortexx2/digit-predictor/
9/12/21, 2:15 PM - V: Have you used k fold cv instead of regular hold out
9/12/21, 2:15 PM - V: Or tried using 3 way holdout
9/12/21, 2:17 PM - V: Try this only if dataset is large enough or it will form a pessimistic bias by withholding info
9/12/21, 2:23 PM - V: Most likely your model is  overfitting instead of using a simple nn try ensembles
9/12/21, 2:27 PM - +91 88794 07747: Since my aim with this was to check out the implementation of CV APIs I've used simple holdout, different models and using K fold is next up on my docket.
9/12/21, 2:28 PM - +91 88794 07747: If you have checked the repo, do you think that the way I'm implementing the predictions on the backend is a reasonable way to do it? Are there any other factors that might hinder which have nothing to do with the model itself?
9/12/21, 2:28 PM - V: Yea it seems your training set info is too much for the model and it is overfitting
9/12/21, 2:28 PM - V: You should really try having a validation set which is stratified
9/12/21, 2:30 PM - +91 88794 07747: I'll try implementing this next
9/12/21, 2:30 PM - V: This stratified splitting helps maintaining equal ratio b/w the sets with randomisation

9/18/21, 12:35 PM - +91 97172 00450 joined using this group's invite link
9/18/21, 5:03 PM - Sanidhya Sharma: would an irrational number be a numerical constant?
9/18/21, 5:10 PM - Mehul Srivastava: Oh demn cool shiz
9/18/21, 5:24 PM - +91 88794 07747: https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf
9/18/21, 5:25 PM - Arijit: Ya eg. Pi
9/18/21, 5:26 PM - Sanidhya Sharma: pi is not a constant
9/18/21, 5:26 PM - Arijit: The ratio between the circumference and diameter is constant
9/18/21, 5:27 PM - Arijit: And also e is irrational
9/18/21, 5:28 PM - Sanidhya Sharma: please tell me when 22/7 terminates
9/18/21, 5:29 PM - Arijit: 22/7 is not the value of pi. It's an approximation
9/18/21, 5:29 PM - Sanidhya Sharma: exactly
9/18/21, 5:29 PM - Arijit: So?
9/18/21, 5:30 PM - +91 78939 07417: what does it have to do with pi being a constant?
9/18/21, 5:31 PM - Sanidhya Sharma: pi is just an approximation of the ratio
9/18/21, 5:31 PM - Arijit: 22/7 is the approximation of the ratio
9/18/21, 5:31 PM - Arijit: Not pi
9/18/21, 5:32 PM - Sanidhya Sharma: if it does not terminate the value is not constant
9/18/21, 5:32 PM - +91 78939 07417: first of all 22/7 is not pi
9/18/21, 5:32 PM - +91 78939 07417: secondly, who said that?
9/18/21, 5:33 PM - Arijit: Dude...
Take n circles of any size.
Find the ratio of circumference to diameter for all of them
It'll be a constant which is = œÄ ‚âà 22/7
9/18/21, 5:33 PM - +91 78939 07417: your questions itself contradicts the statement here
9/18/21, 5:34 PM - Arijit: If you've given any mathematical exam, you might have come accross: *assume* pi to be 22/7 or 3.14
9/18/21, 5:34 PM - V: Its a non terminating repeating number
9/18/21, 5:34 PM - Sanidhya Sharma: yeah we have found pi till 31 tr digits but we still donot know that it will terminate or not
9/18/21, 5:34 PM - +91 78939 07417: 22/7 right? not pi
9/18/21, 5:35 PM - +91 78939 07417: it won't, that's why it is irrational
9/18/21, 5:35 PM - V: Yes we approximate it to that for sake of shutting up bs arguments like this
9/18/21, 5:36 PM - Sanidhya Sharma: yeah that's the ques can it be called as a constant
9/18/21, 5:36 PM - Arijit: Did you read this?
9/18/21, 5:36 PM - Arinjay: why not?
9/18/21, 5:36 PM - +91 78939 07417: can sqrt(2) be treated as a constant?
9/18/21, 5:37 PM - +91 78939 07417: if yes, pi can be too
9/18/21, 5:37 PM - V: Also since only computers calculate any division to 15-16 float points not exact values who are we to oppose
9/18/21, 5:37 PM - Sanidhya Sharma: there is a difference between being treated as and as an actual constant
9/18/21, 5:38 PM - Arijit: And it's not causing the satellites to malfunction/drift away so we're cool with approximations that good
9/18/21, 5:38 PM - V: Exactly
9/18/21, 5:38 PM - +91 78939 07417: the fact that we don't know the value doesn't change the fact that its value is not changing ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
9/18/21, 5:38 PM - Sanidhya Sharma: cause the difference is too small to figure out
9/18/21, 5:38 PM - V: Or to mean something useful
9/18/21, 5:39 PM - Arijit: How small is too small?
9/18/21, 5:39 PM - V: i dont care beyond 2 points tbh
9/18/21, 5:39 PM - +91 78939 07417: üòÇ
9/18/21, 5:41 PM - +91 78939 07417: we won't even be able to know the exact value of sqrt(2) ig but we know that it doesn't change..
9/18/21, 5:41 PM - V: So it doesn't matter
9/18/21, 5:41 PM - V: Unless computers somehow have infinite ram
9/18/21, 5:44 PM - Arijit: Why do we need infinite ram tho?
9/18/21, 5:46 PM - V: To approximate calculations to the point it scratches the itch of every person in existence
9/18/21, 5:47 PM - +91 78939 07417: the number doesn't stop or repeat ever, can't be represented in finite no of bits?
9/18/21, 5:48 PM - Arijit: We don't need to save the previous results of division
9/18/21, 5:48 PM - Arijit: Just a loop running with the current value to be divided
9/18/21, 5:48 PM - +91 78939 07417: infinite space/time?
9/18/21, 5:48 PM - Arijit: And when we terminate we'll just get a big computer and run those number of iterations
9/18/21, 5:48 PM - V: How tf did this argument reached here
9/18/21, 5:49 PM - +91 78939 07417: idk, I am hoing with the flow üòÇ

9/18/21, 5:51 PM - +91 78939 07417: I didn't get it, when will we terminate?
9/18/21, 5:51 PM - Arijit: When we get no remainder
9/18/21, 5:51 PM - Arijit: Like 22/7 -> 3 (1/7)
9/18/21, 5:51 PM - Arijit: Now we focus only on the 1/7 part
9/18/21, 5:52 PM - +91 78939 07417: no, no. i am talking about irrational numbers
9/18/21, 5:53 PM - +91 78939 07417: division doesn't even come to play there
9/18/21, 5:53 PM - +91 78939 07417: .
9/18/21, 5:53 PM - Arijit: Okay I was talking about numbers which haven't been proved irrational

Tips and tricks on prompts to #vqclip. TLDR: 

* Adding rendered in unreal engine, trending on artstation, top of /r/art improves image quality significally.
* Using the pipe to split a prompt into separate prompts that are steered towards independently may be counterproductive.

10/15/21, 7:27 PM - +91 83558 14130: More like using depth maps and masks, and then applying that on top of your image
10/15/21, 7:27 PM - +91 83558 14130: They use this (finally) after getting depth and segmentation maps
10/15/21, 7:28 PM - V: I have read this paper i still am unclear about maps and masks

10/19/21, 10:50 AM - V: I hate the notch the product is nice
10/19/21, 10:50 AM - Hardik: way too pricey tho
10/19/21, 10:50 AM - Hardik: seems like an exclusive for industry people
10/19/21, 10:50 AM - Hardik: that too only the creators
10/19/21, 10:51 AM - V: Not paying for intel for the same price

10/19/21, 10:54 AM - +91 84490 15296: No matter how modern the equipment they still use SD cards ..
10/19/21, 10:54 AM - +91 84490 15296: Atleast till date
10/19/21, 10:54 AM - Rishabh: Exactly.
10/19/21, 10:54 AM - Rishabh: Do people know how old SD and HDMI ports are.
10/19/21, 10:55 AM - V: Hdmi 2.1 is actually pretty new
10/19/21, 10:55 AM - Rishabh: Apple pushed things forward introduced the. First USB CD/R drives when no one knew about it.
10/19/21, 10:55 AM - V: But thunderbolt 4 is üî•
10/19/21, 10:56 AM - Rishabh: The standard, that‚Äôs a new skin
10/19/21, 10:56 AM - Rishabh: Thunderbolt is much more capable than any port.
10/19/21, 10:56 AM - V: Thunderbolt supported displays are expensive bruh
10/19/21, 10:57 AM - Arijit: The laptop in question is also expensive yaar
10/19/21, 10:57 AM - Rishabh: Ever think why? They are better.
10/19/21, 10:57 AM - V: I only hate the notch product is nice
10/19/21, 10:57 AM - Rishabh: Support up to 16K I think?
10/19/21, 10:57 AM - Rishabh: Lol
10/19/21, 10:58 AM - V: They also pushed butterfly keyboard switches the world then got to know about that better than anyone
10/19/21, 10:58 AM - Rishabh: Tech is good, product was shit for me.
10/19/21, 10:58 AM - V: I still don't get the notch

10/19/21, 11:00 AM - Rishabh: lol idk now.
10/19/21, 11:00 AM - V: Just put the notch forget everything else next year
10/19/21, 11:01 AM - Rishabh: Price cmon man.
10/19/21, 11:01 AM - V: Retarded Design decision
10/19/21, 11:01 AM - Rishabh: M1 originally was priced aggressively wtf is this?!
10/19/21, 11:01 AM - Arijit: If they had included face id like tech in the notch, it would have been justifiable
10/19/21, 11:01 AM - Rishabh: 3499 Entry into Max
10/19/21, 11:01 AM - +91 98185 04552: This was expected M1 was a trial
10/19/21, 11:01 AM - V: Not going to say anything until realtime benchmarks come out
10/19/21, 11:02 AM - Rishabh: .
10/19/21, 11:02 AM - V: But if apple marketing is anything to go by they are worth it
10/19/21, 11:02 AM - Rishabh: Thats a 3090 in a Mac I dont care how better the benchmarks are man.
10/19/21, 11:03 AM - Rishabh: Max they are maximising profit 3499 entry is crazy even for apple.

10/20/21, 6:19 PM - V: Literally they said why choose which type of layer concatenated them all together
10/20/21, 6:19 PM - Astitva: NDN limits the depth to 10-12 and relies on communication channels across streams
10/20/21, 6:21 PM - V: Basically using higher quality images depthwise convolutions instead of Normal to reduce computational costs
10/20/21, 6:21 PM - +91 83558 14130: aek toh this model seems to be used for generation and solbing symbolic math
10/20/21, 6:21 PM - +91 83558 14130: NDN?
10/20/21, 6:22 PM - Astitva: Its essentially using multiple streams of similar depths (as opposed to wider layers) to mitigate the computational overhead of deeper models
10/20/21, 6:22 PM - Rishabh: Non deep NN
10/20/21, 6:23 PM - V: So similarly sized multiple layers in parallel to each other instead chunky stacks
10/20/21, 6:23 PM - Astitva: yup
10/20/21, 6:23 PM - +91 83558 14130: @919315996705  Want GPT3 to summarize this paper (some part of it?)

10/25/21, 1:17 PM - V: Its a simple answer because Linear activations can't learn complex representations how deep may they be
10/25/21, 1:18 PM - +91 83558 14130: Yup ans so because gradient always might be same ig
10/25/21, 1:18 PM - V: If an activation is a line it can only classify things as above it or below it
10/25/21, 1:19 PM - V: It would find local minima but would struggle to find global minima

But due to securities laws that might have deemed this a sale of securities, this was not legally advisable. So, had the DAO successfully purchased the document, the ConstitutionDAO tokens would only have conferred voting power for members on matters relating to what to do with the document."

It will convert the entire earth into a huge brain, capable of responding in every one of its parts. By the employment of a number of plants, each of which can transmit signals to all parts of the world, the news of the globe will be flashed to all points. A cheap and simple receiving device, which might be carried in one‚Äôs pocket, can be set up anywhere on sea or land, and it will record the world‚Äôs news as it occurs, or take such special messages as are intended for it. If you are in the heart of the Sahara your wife can telegraph you from Washington, and if the instrument is properly made you alone will get the message. A single plant of a few horse power could operate hundreds of such instruments, so that the invention has an infinite working capacity and will cheapen the transmission of all kinds of intelligence."

At inference time (e.g. in `evaluate()`), usually such weights aren't available (because, in a realistic setting, weights are a type of label) and so they get ignored by your metrics. You will see unweighted metrics even if you pass `sample_weight`. https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1471067582493085707?s=20

12/25/21, 9:47 PM - +91 77427 26932: Woah
12/25/21, 9:47 PM - +91 77427 26932: Is Kojimas studio also using the same engine?
12/25/21, 9:47 PM - V: Thats Decima
12/25/21, 9:48 PM - V: Guerilla games guys gifted that engine to him
12/25/21, 9:48 PM - +91 77427 26932: My bad
12/25/21, 9:48 PM - V: Resulting in kojima prod opening in Netherlands and setagaya at the same time
12/25/21, 9:54 PM - Rishabh: Oh nice Ansec in Netherlands?

12/26/21, 8:13 PM - Rishabh: Fuck materialUI to be honest.
12/26/21, 8:24 PM - +91 83558 14130: why Sir
12/26/21, 8:27 PM - Rishabh: There are other design philosophies in the world.
12/26/21, 8:28 PM - +91 83558 14130: Hmm agreed. But why fuck materialUI?
12/26/21, 8:28 PM - +91 83558 14130: like why you hate it?
12/26/21, 8:28 PM - Rishabh: Browse React Templates.
12/26/21, 8:30 PM - Rishabh: Don't hate it, there's a place to use it and there are places to not.

12/26/21, 8:41 PM - V: Ever looked at fluent design
12/26/21, 8:41 PM - V: Or carbon
12/26/21, 8:41 PM - V: Or polaris
12/26/21, 8:42 PM - V: Or lightning
12/26/21, 8:43 PM - V: On an app where too much information is displaying at once i agree material clutters things
12/26/21, 8:44 PM - Rishabh: Great read!
12/26/21, 8:44 PM - V: Ikr
12/26/21, 8:44 PM - Rishabh: Yes! Apple presentatiobs.
12/26/21, 8:45 PM - V: Apple does have a design guidelines section but no design system
12/26/21, 8:45 PM - Rishabh: Yeah their human design guidelines forgot what it's called now is good
12/26/21, 8:45 PM - Rishabh: Does not speak about deaign philosophies though.
12/26/21, 8:46 PM - V: Google was  first to this scene thats why material was hyped
12/26/21, 8:47 PM - V: I don't like navigating through my phones ui xD
12/26/21, 8:47 PM - V: Carbon is getting a redesign this year @919082216009
12/26/21, 8:47 PM - Rishabh: Yeah
12/26/21, 8:48 PM - Rishabh: Same.
12/26/21, 8:48 PM - Rishabh: Apple has lost its design touch that's for sure.
12/26/21, 8:48 PM - Rishabh: After OS 9
12/26/21, 8:48 PM - Rishabh: Then FB
12/26/21, 8:48 PM - V: Its just that when automation algorithms decide what to do human centric approach takes a backseat
12/26/21, 8:49 PM - Rishabh: Nothing called UX left.
12/26/21, 8:49 PM - V: Shitty instagram
12/26/21, 8:49 PM - V: Literal shit
12/26/21, 8:49 PM - Rishabh: What carbon?
12/26/21, 8:49 PM - V: Ibms design system
12/26/21, 8:49 PM - Rishabh: Fuck that's the worse
12/26/21, 8:49 PM - V: Literally clunky and impractical
12/26/21, 8:49 PM - Rishabh: People are settling for the lowest common denominator.
12/26/21, 8:50 PM - +91 77427 26932: Yeaaa
12/26/21, 8:50 PM - Rishabh: Does it even have a design?
12/26/21, 8:50 PM - +91 77427 26932: Its tooo stuffed with all features at the moment
12/26/21, 8:50 PM - Rishabh: Spatial UIs are interesting.
12/26/21, 8:50 PM - V: You deleted this message
12/26/21, 8:50 PM - +91 77427 26932: Whats spatial UI?
12/26/21, 8:51 PM - Rishabh: Have to find the link TLDR infinite canvas UI
12/26/21, 8:51 PM - V: Its more of game design thing rather than ux
12/26/21, 8:51 PM - Rishabh: I know that website Vikram
12/26/21, 8:51 PM - V: I spammed that
12/26/21, 8:51 PM - V: üòÇ
12/26/21, 8:51 PM - Rishabh: Not that Spatial UI
12/26/21, 8:52 PM - Rishabh: Look into Bret Victor
12/26/21, 8:52 PM - V: Interaction design ?
12/26/21, 8:53 PM - V: A lot of principles of interaction design work in games too
12/26/21, 8:53 PM - V: Thats why Nintendo makes their games feel premium even though they are mobile games
12/26/21, 8:56 PM - V: Or why good  4x games still manage to convey so much essential information and not overwhelming the player
12/26/21, 9:05 PM - Rishabh: Yeah
12/26/21, 9:06 PM - Rishabh: Basically created human interfaces for Apple
12/26/21, 9:06 PM - Rishabh: Yeah
12/26/21, 9:06 PM - Rishabh: Information overload is not a concept these days for designers loo
12/26/21, 9:07 PM - Rishabh: Useless information
12/26/21, 9:07 PM - +91 77427 26932: Only profit is
12/26/21, 9:08 PM - Rishabh: There's this guy
12/26/21, 9:08 PM - Rishabh: Who makes constraint.systems
12/26/21, 9:08 PM - V: Not app designers but strategy games have a bunch of information on everything
12/26/21, 9:09 PM - Rishabh: True game HUD design is also the same shit
12/26/21, 9:09 PM - Rishabh: Every fucking gane
12/26/21, 9:10 PM - Rishabh: Titanfall and RESPAWN innovated

12/26/21, 9:20 PM - V: Gui as a service
12/26/21, 9:20 PM - Rishabh: I‚Äôll buy it lol that‚Äôs called an OS
12/26/21, 9:21 PM - V: Unless the os i gentoo
12/26/21, 9:21 PM - V: In which every app has to be manually compiled

12/28/21, 9:40 PM - V: Lmao
12/28/21, 9:41 PM - V: Bruh keras subclassing api is basically Pytorch
12/28/21, 9:53 PM - Rishabh: The type of people who can't afford a GPU -- damn
12/28/21, 9:53 PM - Rishabh: Great replies lol
12/28/21, 10:21 PM - V: Why does anyone have anything against tf
12/28/21, 10:34 PM - Arijit: Not everyone is rich and lives in a first world country
12/28/21, 10:35 PM - Arijit: And what's the relation bw gpu and someone hating TF
12/28/21, 10:42 PM - V: Tensor computation run well on gpu üòÇ
12/28/21, 11:19 PM - +91 83558 14130: so PyTorch us computing what by your logic
12/28/21, 11:19 PM - +91 83558 14130: Honestly Tf api sucks
12/28/21, 11:20 PM - +91 83558 14130: due to tf.compat.experimental.v1. and stuff like tf.activations.experimental.whatever 
backward compatibility is an absolute messsss
12/28/21, 11:23 PM - V: Pytorch can also do the same on cpu its just it runs faster on the gpu  the joke was people who complain about tf can't afford the gpu
12/28/21, 11:23 PM - +91 83558 14130: Bas joke üòÇ
12/28/21, 11:23 PM - +91 83558 14130: *bad
12/28/21, 11:23 PM - V: What does anyone say to the guy who hates tf for no apparent reason
12/28/21, 11:24 PM - +91 83558 14130: The api sucks to be really honest it's a mess
12/28/21, 11:24 PM - +91 83558 14130: it's khichdi
12/28/21, 11:24 PM - V: Tf backcompat functions should never be used there are v2 implementations for thr same now
12/28/21, 11:24 PM - +91 83558 14130: Yea but if you want to run legacy code then it almost never runs properly
12/28/21, 11:25 PM - V: Thats the disadvantage of being first
12/28/21, 11:25 PM - +91 83558 14130: Theano?
12/28/21, 11:25 PM - +91 83558 14130: big game yeaa
12/28/21, 11:28 PM - V: Tf was Google brains internal Library which they open sourced when Facebook was beefing up torchMl and jax was open sourced by deepmind
12/28/21, 11:28 PM - V: Popular papers from cvpr 2018 -19 were implemented in lua and matlab
12/28/21, 11:28 PM - +91 83558 14130: idk but pytorch has become very big like TF now
12/28/21, 11:29 PM - +91 83558 14130: Btw have you tried Jax? How's it compared to TF?
12/28/21, 11:29 PM - V: No i haven't at least not yet
12/28/21, 11:30 PM - V: Jit is cool but i need metal gpu support for a library i try once in a while to run the model locally
12/28/21, 11:31 PM - V: Currently tf is the only one which has the support for metal gpu
12/28/21, 11:32 PM - Rishabh: Afaik it only has plug-in support?
12/28/21, 11:33 PM - V: Yes
12/28/21, 11:33 PM - V: But this is the best solution there currently is
12/28/21, 11:33 PM - V: To run on m1 macs
12/28/21, 11:34 PM - Rishabh: https://paperswithcode.com/trends
12/28/21, 11:35 PM - +91 83558 14130: Tf is dead for research at least
12/28/21, 11:35 PM - +91 83558 14130: it's not that you CANT but it's about how much pain you can bear while using TF
12/28/21, 11:38 PM - V: Lol wut
12/28/21, 11:38 PM - V: Tf is very much alive bruh
12/28/21, 11:38 PM - +91 83558 14130: Tf will die trust me
12/28/21, 11:38 PM - +91 83558 14130: it will become like Java one day
12/28/21, 11:38 PM - +91 83558 14130: maybe not as bad
12/28/21, 11:39 PM - +91 83558 14130: but a bit like that
12/28/21, 11:39 PM - V: 185 papers were from google + deepmind this year  guess what framework did they implement it in xD
12/28/21, 11:39 PM - +91 83558 14130: Once Jax is matured bye bye Tr
12/28/21, 11:39 PM - +91 83558 14130: *Tf
12/28/21, 11:39 PM - +91 83558 14130: Haan yea Google will force you to use Tf lmao
12/28/21, 11:39 PM - +91 83558 14130: other than? üòÇ
12/28/21, 11:40 PM - V: Unlike research scaled up code can't do that bruh
12/28/21, 11:40 PM - +91 83558 14130: what?
12/28/21, 11:41 PM - V: Code deployed on software which is widely in use
12/28/21, 11:41 PM - +91 83558 14130: ohk yes
12/28/21, 11:41 PM - +91 83558 14130: that's why it's alive lol
12/28/21, 11:42 PM - V: I was coming home from jaipur to Delhi and i was sitting with a sde 3 from airtel
12/28/21, 11:42 PM - V: They still use spring boot pretty much in the industry
12/28/21, 11:42 PM - +91 83558 14130: Also French companies love Tf
12/28/21, 11:42 PM - V: So tensorflow has much better odds
12/28/21, 11:42 PM - +91 83558 14130: Old tech exists because it's stable and reliable so yess
12/28/21, 11:43 PM - +91 83558 14130: Adoption rate is obv slow for any new tech

1/4/22, 7:15 AM - V: Dropout is a technique used to prevent overfitting by making the model more robust by not learning specific embeddings in your network when the network knows it can't rely on a specific path it uses all paths resulting in better generalization performance
1/4/22, 7:17 AM - V: Also Pytorch, tensorflow have a implementation of Dropout so that it is easy for us to use it

1/4/22, 9:01 AM - +91 88794 07747: @919315996705 Thank you for your detailed response üòä, while you did help me understand how the nn.Dropout module works in this case, my doubt is a bit different than what you have outlined here, I believe. I learned about how some of the information will still pass through despite the random variables being 0 from this article: https://towardsdatascience.com/dropout-on-convolutional-layers-is-weird-5c6ab14f19b2. 
Also, if I have n channels in a particular layer, and I apply dropout to a 2d or higher dimensional map, what use does that serve, especially if by random chance some of the most important features of the input map can get zeroed out, without which it would be unreasonable to learn anything. This same concept was used in the DropBlock paper (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/file/7edcfb2d8f6a659ef4cd1e6c9b6d7079-Paper.pdf) which I have only skim read, but doesn't seem as useful as something like nn.Dropout2d which should work somewhat similarly to dropout in MLPs. So, I still don't understand why we are using single dimensional dropout.
1/4/22, 9:45 AM - V: In case of higher dimensions believe Dropout works as selecting any dimension and switching of that path also ml of n - dimensional data is something which is a current challenge in computer vision also dropout doesn't count permutance of features when switching off paths doing that it would make sure that the model doesn't rely on a feature you want it to learn and will generalize on the data which you test your model on perfectly
1/4/22, 9:48 AM - V: Considering that we deal with  higher dimensions dropblock as discussed in the above provided paper cuts of a particular chunk of the network instead of nodes for achieving the same purpose
1/4/22, 9:51 AM - V: These methods have a chance to cut out important features yes but they have a equal chance to block out other features as its goal is to make a model generalize well not learn the most important features and overfit on that
1/4/22, 9:56 AM - V: Tho there are methods which punish the model which increase model error severely by shuffling features and which doesn't increase the error that much when shuffled

1/5/22, 3:49 PM - +91 95405 97067: Typical of less data they are overfitting in sense that model is now learning the noise associated with the data
1/5/22, 3:50 PM - V: Nope the validation and training accuracy match
1/5/22, 3:50 PM - +91 95405 97067: And not learning anything for generalization of data
1/5/22, 3:50 PM - +91 95405 97067: Training loss is decreasing
1/5/22, 3:50 PM - +91 95405 97067: Take a look once again
1/5/22, 3:51 PM - +91 95405 97067: If your training loss is decreasing while having no effect on validation loss it's pretty much overfitting
1/5/22, 3:51 PM - +91 95405 97067: Validation loss  necessarily don't have to increase
1/5/22, 3:51 PM - V: Still why didn't they show test data
1/5/22, 3:51 PM - V: Test set performance generally gives a better idea
1/5/22, 3:52 PM - +91 95405 97067: Test data is purely out sample data as there has to be a some dataset which is not seen by model
1/5/22, 3:52 PM - +91 95405 97067: Even though we are not training on validation data there is some data leakage from validation to training
1/5/22, 3:52 PM - Arijit: Atm this ain't over fitting
1/5/22, 3:53 PM - +91 95405 97067: I feel it's overfitting
1/5/22, 3:53 PM - Arijit: Yep
1/5/22, 3:53 PM - V: They should have  used augmentation if less data is an issue
1/5/22, 3:53 PM - Arijit: Depends on how you split your data
1/5/22, 3:54 PM - Arijit: And what kind of data it is
1/5/22, 3:55 PM - +91 95405 97067: I am not sure about this but i feel it's definitely overfitting
1/5/22, 3:55 PM - Rishabh: Which paper?
1/5/22, 3:55 PM - Arijit: I guess there would have been a sharp decrease in validation loss if it was over fitting
1/5/22, 3:55 PM - Arijit: Increase*
1/5/22, 3:56 PM - V: Imo 80 percent is not a sign for overfitting
1/5/22, 3:56 PM - +91 95405 97067: No validation loss necessarily don't have to increase
1/5/22, 3:56 PM - +91 95405 97067: For overfitting
1/5/22, 3:56 PM - Arijit: Training accuracy would have been much much greater than val accuracy
1/5/22, 3:57 PM - V: Exactly they are same almost
1/5/22, 3:58 PM - V: To improve performance ensembling and augmentation would be great
1/5/22, 3:58 PM - V: But would have to see the paper before judging
1/5/22, 4:01 PM - +91 95405 97067: https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_do_I_reduce_my_validation_loss


I found thr exact question
1/5/22, 4:01 PM - +91 95405 97067: Expectedly low amount of data which needs to be fixed by augmentation
1/5/22, 4:01 PM - +91 95405 97067: Yes i can attest to that

1/5/22, 5:00 PM - +91 83558 14130: They just applied CNN then did Avg Pooling X 3 followed by 256 layer FC layer and then output
1/5/22, 5:02 PM - +91 83558 14130: Yup they did say it was very less data
1/5/22, 5:04 PM - V: If this is giving 80 percent on training set as well as near about data on validation then augmentation + training it longer would increase it
1/5/22, 5:05 PM - +91 83558 14130: so it's underfitting right most probably?
1/5/22, 5:07 PM - V: Not its actually fitting well till now
1/5/22, 5:08 PM - +91 83558 14130: Pakka
1/5/22, 5:08 PM - +91 83558 14130: ?
1/5/22, 5:08 PM - V: But if it was trained for longer on same data it would overfit
1/5/22, 5:08 PM - V: Augmentation is certainly best way forward
1/5/22, 5:08 PM - +91 83558 14130: I think it's confusing hecause they showed it on the same graph, and also don't show train acc
1/5/22, 5:09 PM - +91 83558 14130: Or more data?
1/5/22, 5:09 PM - +91 83558 14130: yea essentially this
1/5/22, 5:10 PM - V: Basically less data is easy for the model to overfit on
